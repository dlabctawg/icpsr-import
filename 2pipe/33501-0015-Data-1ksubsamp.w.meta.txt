10419950005157|Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks on H.R. 2853.|104400|950202|31|Hcr02fe95-56 1.txt|685|727|H1078-H1142|2523|444|UT|Enid Greene Waldholtz|H|2|R
10419950005955|Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Speaker, while I support our committee's efforts to obtain all of the relevant information regarding the Travel Office firings, I do not believe that this resolution, which grants authority to staff to conduct sworn depositions, is necessary. Let me add, however, that earlier today the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight adopted procedures to implement the resolution which accord full rights to the minority and the witnesses, and I supported these procedures. The authority granted under this resolution is unnecessary and unwarranted. House Resolution 369 is an unprecedented grant of authority to the staff of a standing committee during the course of an ongoing investigation on the eve of a Presidential election. Under such troubling circumstances, there is a heavy burden on the proponents of the resolution to show a compelling need for such authority. We should not act just for the convenience of the staff, or because of an isolated case of a reluctant witness. There must be a convincing case that without this authority, the committee cannot complete its investigation. I do not believe that this threshold has been met. According to Chairman Clinger's letter to the Rules Committee, the stated reason for the Resolution is that--I'm quoting--``we have been faced with the reluctance and even refusal of certain potential witnesses to voluntarily submit to staff interviews preliminary to a hearing.'' I am aware of no evidence that witnesses have refused to cooperate with the committee during the course of this investigation. Nor have I seen any letters from witnesses refusing to provide information to the committee. Further, I know of no witness who has refused to provide testimony to the committee under oath. The Rules Committee received no documentation nor testimony demonstrating a compelling need for this extraordinary authority. To the contrary, the record suggests that witnesses agreed to cooperate with the committee, except when unwarranted conditions have been demanded by the majority staff. To the extent that witnesses have been reluctant to submit to interviews, it has only been after demands by the majority staff that minority staff not be present, or that interviews be taken under an oath administered by a staff that lacked such authority. Mr. Speaker, both the Parliamentarians and the American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service has told majority staff that there was no authority for staff to take sworn depositions absent a resolution by the House. Yet, knowing full well that they lacked both the authority to require a sworn deposition and the ability to administer an oath to witnesses, the majority staff repeatedly threatened witnesses in an effort to force them to comply. As evidence of this behavior by the majority staff, let me read from a letter to Chairman Clinger dated December 4 of last year, from David H. Williams, the attorney representing Patsy Thomasson: It says in part: Mr. Speaker, I include this letter for the Record at this point: I also include a February 20, 1996, letter from Stephen L. Braga, the attorney representing Catherine Cornelius to Chairman Clinger's staff for the Record. In it, the attorney for Ms. Cornelius agreed to make her available for transcribed interview provided that both majority and minority staff were present. The majority staff turned him down, however, because he would not agree to swearing in his client, even though, as I have stated, the majority staff knew it had no legal authority to do so. The letter is as follows: Mr. Speaker, if the majority staff conducts itself in a professional and non-partisan manner and in keeping with the decorum of the House. I believe they will find no resistance to timely informal interviews. In those cases where there is reluctance, are brought to my attention I will work with the chairman in urging complete cooperation. I sincerely hope and expect that the authority granted by this resolution will be reserved for those few cases where it is absolutely necessary, and not routinely exercised as a substitute for the regular practices of the House. Let me turn to another issue concerning the rights of witnesses. Following discussions with the Parliamentarian, I am aware of no precedent of a witness who has objected to a question or failed to appear for a staff deposition being cited for contempt without an opportunity to explain his actions before the entire committee. This resolution does not supplant existing House rules regarding contempt of Congress and the rights accorded to witnesses. Nothing in this resolution would require a contempt citation simply because a witness under subpoena refuses to appear before or answer questions in a staff deposition. Prior to any action, the committee should give the witness an opportunity to respond fully at a duly called hearing of the committee, with a proper quorum of members present. In closing, let me thank Chairman Clinger for his cooperation earlier today in adopting committee implementing rules which accord full rights to the minority and the witnesses. I have also received a letter from Chairman Clinger further clarifying how he intends to interpret these rules. I include the committee rules and the chairman's letter for the Record, as follows:|104128|950203|257|Hcr03fe95-77 1.txt|3882|3882|H1168-H1191|39|7|IL|Cardiss Collins|H|7|D

10419950008401|Mr. Chairman, this amendment deals with striking the family immigration sections of the bill in order to address these issues in a more seemly and deliberative manner, and I agree with that. If we are for family values, we need to value families; and that is what the Berman amendment would do. However, disapproval of the Berman amendment will also have implications for the business community. I recently received a letter from a Mr. Yao, who lives in Mountain View, CA. I cannot read his whole letter, but I can excerpt from it. He is a senior scientist at his company, an American company, and is originally from China. When he started with the company, it was a very small company, but it has since experienced rapid growth and expansion. Its products are well received. In fact, the company received an award for outstanding achievement from the White House. The major reason why the company has done so well is that Mr. Yao has designed all of the antennas that the company sells and in fact is the holder of a number of patents. However, a few years ago, he missed his daughter in China so much that he was going to take his patients and go home to China. However, the company, fearing to lose him and to lose their business, petitioned to make him a permanent resident so that his daughter could come here. He wrote to me to say that she is now 30 years old, and he is desperate to see her, but she cannot come for a visit because of the pending application. Mr. Chairman, I guess the upshot is that, if the Smith bill passes without the Berman amendment, Mr. Yao can take his patents and go home to China. Then we can have the opportunity to compete with a Chinese company that he founds instead of dominating our economic adversaries abroad. I think it is worth noting that one of the fastest growing companies in our country, Intel, was founded by an immigrant. Sun Microsystems was founded by immigrants. The Java computer technology that is taking off on the Internet was devised by an immigrant. We are shooting ourselves in the foot if we fail to adopt the Berman amendment, economically, and also hurting families.|104222|950210|4|Hcr10fe95-60 1.txt|72|153|H1604-H1608|5184|969|MS|Gene Taylor|H|5|D
10419950010486|Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield further, first of all we are not here to either praise Caesar or bury Caesar, Caesar being the current Tax Code; we are here to come up with an amendment to make it more difficult to raise taxes. I guess what I might have said when I said ``least offensive,'' we wanted to use a term that was as close to revenue neutrality as possible, without saying revenue-neutral, because it is physically impossible if you want to change the entire tax system or you want to monitor it or modify it in some way, to speculate down to the penny that the change is not going to increase taxes. So de minimis was as close to revenue-neutral in terms of terminology as we could get.|104275|950216|159|Hcr16fe95-87 1.txt|2512|2513|H1862-H1890|89|16|NY|Benjamin A. Gilman|H|20|R
10419950011475|I was going to say, whether you are talking about tax reform, health care reform, Medicare reform, welfare reform, reforming the way Congress does business, opening up the process, really what this debate is about is whose country is it, and whose government is it, and who is in charge, and whose money is it? And for too long we have sort of taken, or our predecessors have taken the attitude in Washington that it is Washington's money and Washington's government. One of my favorite Presidents once observed we are a people with a government, and not the other way around. And really all of these reforms are about opening up the process. The beauty of this Congress is for the first time we are having honest and healthy debates about what kind of a Medicare system we are going to have, what kind of welfare system should we have? We have agreed that the problem with our welfare system is not that it costs so much money. The problem with our welfare system in America today is that it costs too much in human potential. We have created dependency. When Representative Tauzin talks about our tax system, it is a system riddled with perverse incentives. Throughout all of our programs, it is a system of perverse incentives. No good deed goes unpunished. Frankly, it is wrong, and the America people know it is wrong. If there is a reform party, I think once the American people get a chance to look at these issues, what has really happened in the 104th Congress, how the process has been opened up, how we finally had honest debates about real reform, returning more power back to the people, I think they will agree that there is a reform party in the United States of America, and it is our party, and it is this party that forged those reforms, it is this freshman class, if you will, that has really forced the agenda to make those changes, to change the attitudes in Washington, and begin the process of giving the people the power back. And that is what this Congress is about. I hope that as we go forward, we will have more opportunities this spring to have this kind of a dialog, this kind of a discussion, because I believe facts are our friends, and once the American people have the facts, whether it is about our budget, about Medicare, about tax reform, all of those other issues, I think it makes it very easy for us to win the debate, for them to win the debate, because facts are our friends and, as John Adams said, ``Facts are stubborn things.''|104121|950222|102|Hcr22fe95-85 1.txt|3603|3630|H2010-H2029|1784|310|ID|Michael D.

Costello|H|12|D
10419950019240|Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word Mr. Chairman, although I anticipate much partisanship in the debate over H.R. 3322, I want to point out that the National Science Foundation enjoys strong bipartisan support. I want to thank Basic Research Subcommittee Chairman Schiff for the professional, nonpartisan manner in which he has conducted himself on all matters within Basic Research's jurisdiction, including the NSF. On the NSF budget generally, I hope that we will continue to maintain our history of bipartisan advocacy. The support that NSF provides in meeting a wide variety of challenges in math, science, and engineering education cannot be overstated. In my region, both Carnegie-Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh rely heavily on NSF support to conduct important research in a number of areas. What concerns me enough to rise at this point, is the future of NSF's Supercomputing Program. The Basic Research Subcommittee has held two hearings relating to the Supercomputing Program, one on the high performance computing and communications initiative in general, and one on NSF's decision to recompete its Supercomputing Program. The common theme in these two hearings was that we are letting funding issues compromise the integrity of what has been recognized by Members in both parties as a model program. What especially disturbs me is NSF's decision to ``recompete'' its leading edge centers based upon the findings of the Hayes Report. The Hayes Report found that there needed to be greater emphasis placed on regional computing centers in order to ease the extreme burden being placed on the four leading-edge centers. I agree that the best way to help meet the demands for user time at the leading-edge centers is to increase the capabilities of the regional centers. If there are projects that require less capacity, or the merits of larger projects can be initially judged at the regional centers, then we should pursue it. What troubles me is that the only way anyone has chosen to enhance the regional centers is at the expense of the leading-edge centers. In other words, NSF has decided that the way to solve one problem is to create another, potentially more serious problem. We are confronted with a situation where, in order to enhance the ability to access a valuable research tool, we are going to reduce that tool's capacity. I know that this situation is of concern to Members on both sides of the aisle. During the hearing on the Supercomputing Program there were many Members in both parties who said that if money was the only force driving the downsizing of leading-edge centers, then we should find the money elsewhere and not deconstruct one of our Government's greatest success stories. I do not take issue with formalizing the relationships between leading-edge and regional facilities through the proposed partnership centers. However, witnesses at our hearing seemed quite clear that there was nothing about the reorganization that was leading to a potential downsizing of leading-edge centers. Rather, it was budgetary concerns that were driving this process. In response to a question posed by Congressman Boehlert, Dr. Ed Hayes, chairman of the task force on the Future of NSF Supercomputing Centers, stated: Later, in response to a question I posed about why we were considering downsizing centers that were over subscribed, Dr. Hayes said: Despite the assertions of NSF that funding is not the issue here, our committee's hearing record seems to indicate otherwise. Rather, it seems to me that the recompetition is based upon NSF trying to predict future funding decisions by the Congress. In this case, it seems like the analysis of the task force was done correctly, but they then went beyond the scope of their mission by presupposing future funding decisions by Congress. My admonition to the NSF is not to base policy decisions by guessing how the Science Committee is going to act. As we just witnessed with the Schiff amendment, preordained authorization caps have a way of changing around here. If current funding for the Supercomputing Program is not sufficient to keep the United States as a world leader in high- speed computing, let us know, and we will act accordingly. I do not intend to offer an amendment at this point. But I do want to put the NSF on notice that there are many Members of Congress who are watching the recompetition with a watchful eye, and are not necessarily pleased with what they have seen so far.|104900|950316|95|Hcr16mr95-67 1.txt|1183|1184|H3281-H3303|57|8|NA|Speaker|NA|NA|N/A
10419950019526|Mr. Speaker, I would simply like to observe that this seems to me to be nothing but a blatantly political act. The question is not what the President has said he will or will not do. I hope he will provide ample opportunity for Wisconsin to get what it is asking for, after he has met his responsibilities and we have met ours, to understand what it is we are helping to support.

10419950021345|Mr. Speaker, if I told you that you owed me $50 a month for 30 years would you pay it if you did not have to? If you answer yes, I have some private mortgage home insurance [PMI] for you. But if no is your answer, then why are thousands of people doing it? Private mortgage insurance [PMI] is to provide lenders--or the ultimate purchaser of a loan--protection against a home owner's non- payment. The insurance typically insures a percentage of any potential loss. The majority of people buying homes nowadays put down less than the traditional 20 percent of the home purchase price. As a result, many of these homeowners have accepted the fact that they have to commit a part of their monthly home mortgage payment--typically $50 to $90 to pay for mortgage insurance. The problem arises when the homeowner overpays private mortgage insurance; can't cancel the PMI; or is not told that they have the right to cancel it. It is not a new problem, but one that has made many servicers and insurers rich. It has been going on for years. What makes private mortgage insurance even more sinister is that those who are mostly taken by it are the ones that need the money most, once they are not required to pay it. Nineteen years ago, a secretary in Dallas, TX, purchased her home for $26,000. She financed $22,950 and was required to purchase private mortgage insurance [PMI], which is required as a condition of making a loan to a homeowner with less than 20 to 25 percent down on a home. At no time was she told that she had a right to cancel the mortgage insurance. Over 19 years later, she and her husband are still paying PMI. Why? Her current loan to value ratio is almost 90 percent, which means that her debt is 10 percent of the value of her home. Her home mortgage servicer continues to charge these premiums every month even though it knows that the PMI is unnecessary when it passes a certain amount. In fact, her home mortgage servicer has been charging her for PMI, even though the owner of her home mortgage requires zero insurance. Moreover, she has been required to overinsure her home mortgage for years. As the investor's insurance requirement decreased, her servicer continued to keep the original coverage amount in place. So, she has been a victim of paying insurance for too long. Her servicer has been overinsuring her home loan, and failing to cancel the insurance when it knew she had the right to, and failed to even tell her that she could insist on the cancellation of the insurance. She is not alone. The above example is just one of the 315,000 homeowners that her lender services. Her lender, even at the more conservative fee of $50 a month for PMI, could theoretically collect tens of millions of dollars a year in PMI charges for the home mortgages it holds. It is time that we stop the scam. It is time to stop sticking it to hardworking homeowners. I have introduced H.R. 3556 that will correct this problem and will: First, require the lender or person making or arranging the loan to disclose to the homeowner that PMI is and how it can be canceled and second, provide the homeowner with the right to cancel PMI. If the borrower has met the mortgage owners requirements for cancellation, ie., a good payment history and if once the equity in the property has reached or exceeded 20 percent of the original appraised value of home. This bill will continue to protect mortgage lenders, insurers and mortgage servicers, while at the same time protecting thousands of people throughout the United States who have PMI long after all requirements for release are met.|104900|950324|1|Hcr24mr95-115 1.txt|12|14|H3795|107|18|NA|Speaker|NA|NA|N/A

10419950023274|Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join Senator Barbara Boxer in introducing legislation to improve our transportation infrastructure along the United States border with Mexico. The border area has become a popular campaign stop for those who publicly attack decades of Federal neglect along the border, but who propose few solutions to the problem. Senator Boxer and I have a solution. This bill would provide critical Federal funding for border improvements without affecting Federal highway assistance to our border States. It will keep our border cities and States from having to absorb the costs of building the roads, bridges, railroads, and highways needed to implement Federal trade policy. The $500 million border infrastructure fund which would be established by our legislation would pay for construction and improvements to the area infrastructure. Our bill would also authorize a Federal loan program to reopen what we in San Diego call the jobs train--the San Diego &amp; Arizona Eastern Railroad. With direct rail connections to the east, the Port of San Diego can become the center of commercial activity and we can transform the economy of this entire region. American investment in roads, highways, airports, seaports, and railroads have been responsible for creating the most advanced and efficient economy in the history of the world. Business leaders and elected officials remain united in the belief that improving our transportation infrastructure is the key to growing our economy. When Congress approved NAFTA, we all knew that ensuring its success would require that all parties provide the necessary infrastructure to facilitate the flow of trade. We believed that inherent in the passage of this agreement was a commitment to build, repair, and maintain the physical infrastructure needed to implement the agreement; like State Route 905 and the jobs train in San Diego. Although this has not been the case, and the physical needs of the trade treaty still have not been addressed, this bill will make sure that the Federal Government meets this commitment. As a result of the passage of NAFTA, our country is now taking in increased custom duties, merchandise fees, and revenues from other commerce-related activities. Our proposal would direct that those funds, collected as a result of our increased trade, be reinvested into the roads, bridges, railways, harbors, and airports that support that trade. My own district has two unfunded NAFTA mandates that our local communities alone cannot address: completion of State Route 905 and revitalization of the San Diego &amp; Arizona Eastern rail line, the jobs train. State Route 905 serves as the only link connecting the Nation's second busiest southern commercial border crossing to the National Interstate Highway System. This road, however, is currently a four-lane city street. It was not intended to carry the additional border traffic that will soon be coming. And it was never intended to be a tool to implement international trade policy. I know this is also the case in numerous other border crossing communities. The jobs train rehabilitation would revitalize San Diego's rail link to the eastbound rail lines. Repairing and improving this now abandoned railroad would provide direct access to eastern markets for trade arriving through the Port of San Diego and the United States-Mexico border crossing. Our cities and States undergo a constant struggle to build and maintain their own infrastructure. They do not have sufficient funds to single-handedly complete projects which support Federal trade policy. Not funding these projects is the worst kind of unfunded mandate. The Federal Government must meet its responsibility. I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort to provide this vital infrastructure to help our Nation take full advantage of the new global market.|104900|950404|2|Hcr04ap95-135 1.txt|29|30|H4143|64|11|NA|Speaker|NA|NA|N/A

The government has silenced dissidents, and the Tiananmen Square episode could still occur today in China. The use of labor, slave labor, continues in China. In addition, China is responsible for nuclear proliferation, the proliferation of other weapons of mass destruction. There is no dispute about that. It is also clear that the conduct in China is financed because of access to the United States market. It is our consumers that are helping to finance the type of outrageous conduct within China. There is a lopsided balance of payment. We import $33 to $34 billion more products from China than we export ever year. The Jackson-Vanik provisions were expressly created in order to make it clear that access to the U.S. market is not automatic and that nonmarket economies that do not perform to a certain standard are denied access to our market. The United States has shown leadership before. It was the leadership of the United States to use trade sanctions in South Africa that brought down the apartheid practices of that country. It was the United States using the Jackson-Vanik provisions that changed the immigration policies of the Soviet Union. We have used trade policies in Uganda and Romania and other countries to bring about changes in those countries. When we exercise leadership, it is part of the proudest moments in the history of this country. Certainly there are naysayers, naysayers who have financial interests in continuing a relationship with China. We always hear that. But when we stand tall, we bring about change. The United States has done it before, we should do it in China, and I urge my colleagues to support this resolution to make it clear that access to the United States market in China must maintain a standard of acceptable conduct that they do not today.|104900|950515|167|Hcr15my95-64 1.txt|3091|3094|H4934-H4956|66|11|NA|Speaker|NA|NA|N/A

10419950030550|Madam Chairman, I thank my friend from Kansas, Mrs. Meyers, for yielding this time to me. I would like to offer my strong support for H.R. 3734, the Personal Responsibility Act. Welfare hurts people. It hurts those who receive it by creating a culture of dependency that crimps people's desire to benefit themselves and improve their own lives. American taxpayers are willing to help those who need it. But we have grown increasingly tired of footing the bill for those who will not help themselves. Perhaps the most fundamental requirement of America's immigration policy is that immigrants be self-reliant, not dependent on the American taxpayers for support. Since 1882, for over 100 years, those who are likely to become public charges or participate in the welfare system have been inadmissible to our country. Since 1917 noncitizens who become public charges after they enter the United States have, in fact, been subject to deportation. Many immigrants come to America for economic opportunity. In fact, most of them do. However, others come to live off the American taxpayer. Noncitizen welfare recipients of supplemental security income have increased 580 percent over the last 12 years. When all the major welfare programs are added together, studies show that immigrants receive $26 billion each year in welfare assistance. Now, should not those funds rather be going to needy American citizens? This bill complements the House immigration reform bill, H.R. 2202, which passed the House by a vote of 333 to 87. H.R. 2202 prevents illegal aliens from receiving public benefits, enforces the public charge exclusion and deportation provisions of current law and encourages immigrant sponsors to fulfill their financial obligations. It is critical for Congress to send both H.R. 3424 and H.R. 2202 to the President this year. The American people are depending on us to reform America's welfare and immigration policies. President Clinton, after promising to end welfare as we know it, has twice this year vetoed proposals to do just that. Let us hope the administration will finally keep its promise to the American people and sign this bill.|104176|950613|95|Hcr13jn95-88 1.txt|8490|8490|H5833-H5883|51|9|MD|Wayne T. Gilchrest|H|1|R
10419950031033|Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume I rise in opposition to the gentlewoman's amendment. This bill is different from the other 12 regular appropriations bills in that our bill appropriates all funds for the operations of the District government; all funds, not just Federal funds. That is the way the bill is designed. That is why the abortion language in section 129 of our bill restricts the use of all funds for abortions, except to save the mother's life or in cases of rape or incest. I think that is consistent with our appropriations policies. We are appropriating all funds for this bill. The abortion language in our bill this year is identical to the language in last year's bill which was signed by the President. It is also identical to the language in the continuing resolutions that the President signed last year. It is identical to the language in Public Law 104-69 that the President signed on December 22, 1995; to legislation that he signed on January 4, 1996; to legislation that he also signed on January 6, 1996, and to legislation he signed less than 3 months ago on April 26. While I appreciate the gentlewoman's feelings about home rule, the language in our bill does allow the use of funds for abortions in those cases where the life of the mother is endangered or in the case of rape or incest. I believe it is broad enough to give District officials the discretion they need so that the procedure is not misused. Mr. Chairman, as I mentioned just a moment ago, the President, less than 3 months ago, signed a bill with language identical to that found in section 129 of this bill. There is no reason for the President to not approve this language which, again, is identical to language he recently approved. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.|104388|950614|2|Hcr14jn95-89 1.txt|17|66|H5979|1423|253|TX|Henry B. Gonzalez|H|20|D

10419950036773|Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me and for his leadership on the Committee on Commerce, and as my very good friend and colleague, the gentleman from California, and the dean of our delegation, and let me just say I hope we will have future opportunities in the next few weeks as we wrap up our legislative work, but I want to salute Carlos Moorhead for his distinguished service in the Congress and tell him the he will be sorely missed in our ranks, and particularly as the dean of the California Republican congressional delegation. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my legislation, H.R. 3056, a very simple bill that I introduced that makes a technical change to current Medicaid law as it applies to California and my congressional district. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Nevada, Barbara Vucanovich, who is the chairwoman of the Speaker's Corrections Day advisory group, the gentleman from Virginia, Tom Bliley, the chairman of the House Committee on Commerce, the gentleman from Florida, Michael Bilirakis, from the Committee on Commerce, the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Barr, of the Committee on Commerce, the gentleman from California, Mr. Waxman, and the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Dingell, on the minority side, for their help on this legislation. This is a very commonsense bill that would simply allow county health systems that are currently prohibited from providing Medicaid services to eligible recipients in other counties to do so. That is to say, it changes the law by making a technical modification to Medicaid HMO amendments included in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, by specifically inserting the phrase ``or counties'' after the word ``county'' in one place to clarify the intent of the law. What this technical amendment does, of course, is allow a Medicaid HMO, in this case the Solano Partnership Health Plan, a nonprofit Medicaid HMO, to be able to expand out of its home county, its county of origin, if you will, Solano County, to a neighboring and adjacent county, Napa County, and in the process serve an additional 12,000 Medicaid recipients in my district. This legislation, making technical amendments to the law, will provide those 12,000 Medicaid recipients with greater access and greater quality of medical and physician services. It will decrease the reliance on hospital emergency facilities for primary health care for Medicaid beneficiaries. The Congressional Budget Office has scored this legislation and found that it will actually save the taxpayers $500,000 annually. The bill contains no private sector or intergovernmental mandates of any kind. This bill is health care reform at its finest. It offers the neediest of patients greater access to health care, decreases the administrative burden on providers, and allows for more efficient program management, which results in savings and cost containment. Let me suggest to my colleagues that this is the wave or the trend of the future in Medicaid health care services to the truly indigent and desperately poor in our society, a very important part of the American safety net. I happened, flying back yesterday to Washington from my California district, to read an article in USA Today, the headline of which is ``Medicaid Outcome Will Affect All.'' The subheadline is ``The Clinton Administration, Congress, and the Nation's Governors have failed to reach consensus on future of Medicaid. With caseloads rising, the States have had to step up.'' The article starts out by saying, ``President Clinton and Congress succeeded in revamping the Nation's antiquated welfare system'' when we passed through this Congress a bipartisan welfare reform bill that the President signed into law just last month. And it goes on to say, ``President Clinton and Congress succeeded in revamping the Nation's antiquated welfare system this year only by failing a more difficult test. Left in the wake of welfare reform is Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, which dwarfs welfare in both caseload and cost.'' Clearly, Medicaid in recent years, Medicaid expenditures, have been growing at an unsustainable rate. Because this is a 50-50 cost-shared program between Federal taxpayers and State taxpayers, State taxpayers and State government has been asked to pick up an ever-increasing portion of Medicaid health care cost in America. The program cries out for reform. As I mentioned, I believe that the wave of the future in the Medicaid services and in trying to control Medicaid costs is managed care plans such as the Solano partnership health plan. Presently today in America, nearly one-third of all Medicaid recipients are in managed care plans. Those States that have aggressively, those States that have aggressively experimented and expanded Medicaid managed care programs have realized a significant cost savings. Michigan, for example, has put 80 percent of its Medicaid recipients into managed care and cut inflation, the growth of health care cost, from 11 percent to 1 percent in 1 year. To quote health policy adviser Vernon Smith for the Engler administration in Michigan, ``These are real savings.'' So again, Madam Speaker, I believe it is unfortunate we have not been successful in enacting more ambitious or more broad-based Medicaid reform in this session of Congress, but I submit that this legislation is perhaps the only meaningful Medicaid reform that we will be able to enact in the 104th Congress. Again I want to thank the gentleman for being so gracious in yielding me the time today. I want to reiterate, as he said, that this legislation is supported by Governor Pete Wilson, the California State Department of Health Services, and many other organizations in California. This bill is health care reform at its finest. As I mentioned before, this is going to expand access to and quality of health care for 12,000 Medicaid recipients in my district. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.|104137|950712|35|Hcr12jy95-100 1.txt|686|698|H6906-H6912|696|139|IL|Donald A. Manzullo|H|16|R

10419950039392|Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the mental health provisions in this conference report. Earlier this year, I offered an amendment to the health insurance reform bill which would have assured that patients with mental illness could not be discriminated against. It is long past time that this House be given the opportunity to vote on this important issue. Mental illnesses are just as serious of a medical condition as heart disease or cancer, yet insurers have for years not offered complete coverages for the treatment of mental illness. Nearly one out of four of all adults suffer from some type of severe mental illness in the United States each year, yet 95 percent of the major insurance companies in America have limited coverage of psychiatric care. Of the adults in America suffering from mental health problems, less than half are receiving care for their mental illnesses. It is time to eliminate discrimination against mental illness and I applaud this conference report for taking an important first step toward doing that. I would urge my colleagues to support this conference report and the important mental health parity provisions it contains.|104184|950718|135|Hcr18jy95-82 1.txt|2772|2772|H7102-H7135|34|6|MA|John W.

10419950040554|Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend Chairmen Shuster and Boehlert, as well as Mr. Oberstar and Mr. Borski, for all their hand work on this bill, and rise in strong support of this legislation. I came to the floor earlier this summer when the bill first came through the House to discuss two provisions critical to the Houston area, and am very pleased that these provisions remain in this final conference report. One of these is the authorization of funding to deepen and widen the Houston Ship Channel. These improvements are essential to the economic development not only of the region, but of the country generally, as the Houston Ship Channel is a critical economic lifeline between our Nation and the rest of the world. The improvements authorized are also consistent with the Port's and my enduring commitment to the environment. The dredged material from the Ship Channel project will be used to create over 4,000 acres of additional marsh land to be used in developing bird islands, boater destinations, and shoreline erosion projects. The second provision in this bill allows certain flood control districts to carry out flood control projects with far greater flexibility than ever before. Although still subject to the high standards set by the Corps of Engineers, my Harris County Flood Control District officials will now be able to plan, study, design and construct these projects with greater independence and more input from the local community. I am convinced that Harris County will demonstrate that it can design and construct flood projects faster and cheaper when it is not burdened by Federal redtape. In fact, I am told that the Harris County projects will not only be completed much sooner than projected by the Corps, they will be completed at a total cost that is as much as 35 percent less than that projected by the Corps. Again, I strongly support this legislation and urge my colleagues to support it, as well.|104042|950720|5|Hcr20jy95-57 1.txt|350|351|H7265-H7272|55|11|CA|Anthony C. Beilenson|H|24|D

10419950052693|Mr. President, I do not think anybody would try to obscure anything--at least this Senator is not. The obfuscation and the obscuring is to tell the American people that there is a trust fund that we are using moneys from. There is not any trust fund there to be using. It is not there. It is a series of IOU's. So, when we say, ``Oh, you are doing a terrible thing. You are hiding something or you are using the money that should have been there for us,'' that is simply not the case. Let me just review just for the body in 4 more minutes eight rather recent votes on this issue. I can only find eight in the last 30 minutes, since I knew that this would come up on the floor. The amendments are not always offered up by the same Senator. They are offered by different people each time. It is kind of like we do with a ``rolling hold.'' You kind of fire the one barrel and then you fire another barrel. So here it all is, of recent vintage. On January 26, 1995, Senator Harkin offered an amendment. Senator Kempthorne made a second-degree amendment on it. The Kempthorne amendment said that implementing legislation should not cut Social Security. We all agree with that. You cannot miss on that one. If you simply, each time, want to talk about the balanced budget and add to it that we will never ``cut'' Social Security, that is a snapper in here-- except for a few of us who will cast that opposite vote and know very well that it just does not fit. Then Senator Reid tried to table that. That failed. Senator Kempthorne's amendment then passed. Then Senator Harkin tried a perfecting amendment to add his language back, saying that the balanced budget itself should exempt Social Security. That was tabled. On February 10, 1995, Senator Dole offered the amendment to ask the Budget Committee to report instructions not affecting Social Security. That passed 87 to 10, like we all knew it would. Then it was done. Then Senator Reid presented an amendment, February 14 of 1995, saying Social Security is now counted in the balanced budget amendment. And Senator Dole tabled that, 57 to 41. On February 28, 1995 Senator Feinstein offered a substitute for the balanced budget amendment with the exclusion of Social Security. That was tabled 56 to 39. On February 28, 1995, Senator Graham put forward an amendment to eliminate ``held by the public'' from the debt limit, so as to get the balanced budget to exclude Social Security. That was tabled 59 to 40. Another Graham amendment was tabled 57 to 43. This issue has been voted on time and time and time again. I think it is time that it not be voted on again, especially for this issue, on either illegal immigration or health care. Find a new line of work.

10419950053629|Madam President, I want to begin by commending the Senator from Tennessee, the Senator from Missouri, and others, who I believe are sincere in their belief on the need for fundamental reforms in Congress. I disagree with their approach on this issue, but it would be nearly impossible to dispute that the American people expect the Congress to pass meaningful reforms of this institution and they are expecting those reforms soon. Madam President, it is a troubling reality that more and more Americans are finding it difficult to trust their Government and their elected officials. Trusting your Government and having faith in your elected leaders is perhaps the most fundamental tenet of American democracy. Unfortunately, this trust and faith has been shattered by a culture of special interest influence that has convinced the American people that their elected representatives are no longer working in the people's interest, but rather for their own and special interests. But the proposed solution to changing those negative perceptions that we are debating today would, I believe, represent a profound retreat from the principle of representative government itself. Moreover, what we are debating is yet another proposed fundamental change to the U.S. Constitution. Consider that already in the 104th Congress we have debated and voted on a constitutional amendment to balance the budget and a constitutional amendment to prohibit individuals from dishonoring the American flag. It should be pointed out that in the entire 209-year history of our Nation that, excluding the Bill of Rights, we have amended the Constitution just 17 times. Just 17 times Mr. President, in over 200 years. And yet in the 104th Congress alone, almost 140 constitutional amendments have been introduced, from issues ranging from the balanced budget, to tax increases, to flag burning, to school prayer, to the abortion issue and so on. Madam President, I do not believe that we should seek to solve every social ill in our country by making radical alterations to a document that was so carefully crafted 200 years ago and that has provided remarkable guidance to our Nation for so long. We must find alternative solutions. It has, in fact, been well established that the Framers of the Constitution did not believe congressional term limits would be beneficial to the new nation. Let me quote James Madison, the architect of the Constitution, in Federalist Paper No. 53. He wrote the following about his vision of a Congress: It is this point of Madison's that I would like to underscore and that I believe illustrates why it is so important to have a mix of individuals--some experienced and seasoned, others newly elected-- serving in the U.S. Senate. Moreover, it is important for us to consider how the history of the U.S. Senate and this Nation might have been different had term limitations been in effect for the past 200 years. We have had some truly outstanding individuals serve in the U.S. Senate. Republican or Democratic, Conservative, or Liberal, these individuals, whether you agreed with them or not, were defined not only by their tremendous legislative accomplishments but also by their character and the principles they often stood and fought for. Had we had term limits, a great number of these individuals would have been needlessly forced out of office. I am sure that all of my colleagues at one time or another have spent time in the Senate reception room, just outside this Chamber, and noticed the magnificent portraits hanging in that room. In 1955, the U.S. Senate established a commission headed by Senator John F. Kennedy, charging that commission with the responsibility of designating the five greatest U.S. Senators in our Nation's history. After substantial input from other Senators and the academic community, the commission chose Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, Robert M. LaFollette, Sr., and Robert A. Taft, Sr., Portraits of these five Senators are hanging today in the Senate reception room. Clearly, the great legislative and oratory skills exercised by these great figures can be directly attributed to their extended years of service in the U.S. Senate. Interestingly, not a single one of these five greatest Senators served in the Senate for less than 12 years. Taft was the novice, having served only 14 years. Calhoun served 19 years, LaFollette served 22 years and Clay and Webster each served 24 years. And these five Senators are certainly not alone. The history books are full of names such as Humphrey, Dirksen, Goldwater, Hart, and so on. I believe that having experienced Senators in this body is not only healthy for our democracy, but critical to our ability to responsibly carry out the constitutional duties of the legislative branch of Government. Madam President, as a relatively new Member to this body, it has been personally beneficial and an honor to serve with some of the more senior Members, such as the senior Senator from West Virginia, whose mere presence reminds us all of the importance of maintaining a sense of respect and civility and the need to pay deference to this institution and the traditions associated with it that have enduring value. And think about so many effective and honorable Members of the current U.S. Senate whose services would be lost if a term limits law was in effect. In all, 44 current Members of this body--almost half--would not have the ability to continue as U.S. Senators because they have been here for more than 12 years. Mr. President, judging an elected official's commitment, their dedication and their competence by an arbitrary time limit is senseless. Term limits supporters seem to suggest that representing the people is the one profession in America in which having experience makes you underqualified for the job. We must remember that what term limits supporters are asking us to do is to take away the cornerstone of a representative democracy--the right to vote for the candidate of your choice. More than anything else, the freedoms associated with the right to vote are what make Americans the envy of the modern world. We should not take that right away from the American people. We have heard a lot of talk, Mr. President, during this Congress about the importance of devolution, and returning control over local matters to State and local governments. The majority leader wants to ``dust off the 10th amendment'' and we have been told time after time that the Federal Government should stay out of State and local decisionmaking. Well, Mr. President, the legislation before us today makes a mockery out of that principle. The legislation before us provides that the Federal Government will automatically disqualify certain individuals from representing their States and local communities. I believe, and the Framers clearly believed, that neither residents of other States nor elected representatives of other States have the right to tell the people of Wisconsin who they can and cannot vote for, other than the qualifications that are enumerated in the Constitution. And that is what term limits is all about--telling the American people that they are prohibited from voting for a particular representative because that individual has bumped up against some arbitrary deadline. Supporters of term limits argue that if elected officials know that they are only serving for a set amount of time and do not have to be concerned with frequent campaigning, these representatives will be more apt to work in the public's interest, and not their own. Quite frankly, I find this hard to believe. Numerous historical documents demonstrate that the Framers included the concept of frequent elections to the Congress to make representatives directly accountable to those they represent. The rationale was, if a legislator did his job, and adequately represented his constituents and advanced what was in their collective best interests, that representative would be rewarded by reelection. If the legislator was irresponsible, did not perform or fulfill his duties, the voters would exercise their right to replace that particular representative. The ballot box, as it was intended to be by the Framers, is essentially a job performance review for Members of Congress. But term limits would nullify this check, taking these sort of decisions out of the hands of the voters. Moreover, if a Senator is in their final term, knowing they cannot be reelected, it would seem to me that they would be less likely to represent the best interests of their constituents and more likely to represent their own self-interests. After all, they can no longer serve in Congress, they will have to seek future outside employment--maybe with a Washington DC, special interest group or lobbying firm. The argument that term limits would make elected officials more responsible legislators was raised over 200 years ago at the New York ratification convention, to which Alexander Hamilton replied, ``When a man knows he must quit his station, let his merit be what it may, he will turn his attention chiefly to his own emolument.'' Supporters would have us believe that our current system would be supplanted with a class of citizen-legislators, who are less concerned about a career of politics and more concerned about being a truly deliberative body than they are with responding to the whims of the electorate. This line of reasoning sounds like an attempt to reinvent the wheel. First of all, the Congress of the United States is already comprised of a diverse groups of individuals with unique backgrounds in a variety of fields, including education, law, business, journalism, medicine, and yes, politics. Virtually every one of us held jobs in the private sector before we ran for public office, and we will all eventually return to the private sector either when we decide to retire or when our employers, the voters, believe we have overstayed our welcome. I would like to briefly respond to those who suggest that seeking a career in public service is somehow an inherent character flaw. First, let me say that the list of ``professional politicians'' begins with names such as Madison and Jefferson, and ends with figures such as Roosevelt and Kennedy. We should remember that these individuals were truly public servants, and gave little thought to what Alexander Hamilton referred to as ``personal emolument.'' They inspired many of us to enter into public service because we too thought it was a noble and honorable thing to do. Madam President, as I said from the outset, I agree with many of the assumptions and concerns that term limits supporters put forth in their arguments. The election scales today are unquestionably weighted unevenly toward incumbents, and challengers do not have an adequate opportunity to unseat sitting Members of Congress. One very viable alternative to term limits that does not require amending the Constitution--and what I believe represents one of the most important issues facing us today--is the opportunity to reform our campaign finance laws. I am convinced that fundamental campaign finance reform would cure the ills of incumbency that have been derided by term limits supporters and what have unquestionably contributed to the deterioration of fair and competitive congressional elections. That is why I have joined others, including some very noted term limits supporters such as the senior Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, the Senator from Tennessee, Senator Thompson, and others in offering the first bipartisan and bicameral campaign finance reform bill in nearly a decade. This bill has an enormously broad range of bipartisan support. Fifty- six Members of the 104th Congress, including 25 Republicans and 31 Democrats, have signed on to the House and Senate bills. The President supports it. The Ross Perot organization supports it. Common Cause, Public Citizen and newspaper editorials from around the country have endorsed the McCain- Feingold-Thompson legislation. And while only 45 Senators voted earlier this year for a sense of the Senate that we should consider term limits legislation, 57 Senators voted for the resolution I offered last year stating that we should consider campaign finance reform legislation prior to the conclusion of the 104th Congress. This body recently demonstrated on the issue of health reform that Senators from the two parties can set aside their partisan and ideological differences, compromise when necessary and produce a meaningful piece of legislation that will help a great number of people. Campaign finance reform is no different, and I am convinced that there are enough Senators who care about this issue, including many of the supporters of term limits, who can come together and pass a meaningful and comprehensive reform bill. Term limits are no doubt a popular idea, but so is comprehensive campaign finance reform. And if we can solve a problem that all parties seem to agree exists--that is, the unfair advantages held by incumbents--by means other than a constitutional amendment, we should aggressively pursue that avenue before considering such a fundamental change to our Constitution. In a society that considers the right to vote its national treasure and most sacred natural resource, term limits may be the ultimate form of an intrusive and overreaching Federal Government. I urge my colleague to reject this latest proposed change to our Constitution.|104210|951011|7|Hcr11oc95-116 1.txt|185|192|H9867-H9874|493|93|MN|Gil Gutknecht|H|1|R

10419950066756|Madam President, right to the point, that is exactly what is the trouble right this minute. The Finance Committee approved GATT and the WTO. The President of the United States approved GATT and the WTO. Senator Bob Dole approved and led the fight for the approval of GATT and the WTO. Now, why is the President this very minute in France beating up on the council of the seven economic ministers? Why is he beating up on the Japanese, trying to get their attention? Because the World Trade Organization and the GATT agreement has chilled progress in trade disputes. Specifically, the Japanese will not even talk to us. They have WTO. They know they have the vote. So, under 301, we found out we could not use the sanctions, and if we tried to, they would retaliate against us. Not retaliate as the distinguished Senator just referred--that is exactly our dilemma. So they say, point 1, it probably is a matter of terrorism. Because publicly the public can understand that, and we all really regret the loss. I have had 10 of those airmen--we did not lose them--we had 10 hurt in Charleston, and we had from the 9th Air Force, I would say, 30 or 40 at least flying those F-16's out of Shaw Air Base. So I do not talk casually about that. But the real No. 1 trade issue is this dilemma we have gotten into with the World Trade Organization. We are not making any progress at all. We had a semiconductor agreement. Instead of adhering to the agreement, they ignore it now. They said, go to the WTO, go to the WTO. We know that is a loser now. So, politically, before the American people can appreciate --and my distinguished colleague from Iowa can appreciate--the fact that the WTO is a loser, before we can learn that, let us get in ahead of the curve here, of public despondency over the trend of trade in this so-called globalization, globalization, globalization. Specifically, I want to make one good reference that is categorically uncontested. In 1981, we had before then-President Reagan a textile bill. The deficit and the balance of trade in textiles in the United States was $4 billion. The deficit in the European Community in textile trade was $4 billion. I noted just recently, of course, that the Europeans enforce their trade agreements. We do not. We act like we have these rights, and we are in there moving and we are watching and everything else of that kind. We just never have been astute to really go against these dumping cases. We have asked for more customs agents and everything else. The authorities, customs, tell us there are as much as $5 billion in transshipments violations coming in here with this cheap clothing, way less than any kind of minimum wage, child labor and slave labor, you might call it, in the People's Republic, all being manufactured. The deficit and the balance of trade in Europe in textiles is less than $1 billion. The deficit in the balance of textile trade is $35.8 billion. So, the Europeans know how to deal and enforce, and categorically have. We have taken the position of Uncle Sucker. We have done it in defense, and we know it. We have done it in all these other international organizations, and we know it. It is time we start protecting our industrial backbone. America's strength and security rests like on a three-legged stool. We have the one leg of defense. That is unquestioned. That is what they mean by superpower. We have the leg of the values as a Nation, and that is strong. Yes, we feed the hungry in Somalia. We sacrifice for democracy, to build it in Haiti. We commit troops to try to bring peace in Bosnia. So our values, we all know, of the American good will, stand for freedom and democracy the world around. But the third leg of economic strength, that leg was fractured over some 45 to 50 years now. The cold war, where we had to intentionally, in a sense, sacrifice that leg in order to keep the alliance together. But now, with the fall of the wall, we continue to act like we are fat, rich and happy. The American people see it. Why do you think they followed Pat Buchanan wherever he went? Because he was talking sense on trade. I do not agree with him on many of his other stances, but he was solid as a dollar on the subject of jobs and trade. That is why he was picking up Republicans, Democrats, Independents, all, as long as he talked that sense on trade. My workers know, for example, under NAFTA we have already lost, last year, 1995, with the closure of 21 mills, the loss of 10,000 textile jobs. Almost that many already this year have gone down to Mexico and to Malaysia. You go over to the Secretary of Labor and the fine little gentleman gives you the singsong, ``retrain, retrain, retrain.'' Madam President, I wish to get your attention here. If you look at Oneida Mills that just closed--they have been there 37 years--just the other day, 487 workers, most of them female. They make T-shirts. The age average is 47 years of age. Let us retrain them and assume tomorrow morning they are already expert computer operators. Are you going to hire the expert computer operator, 47 years of age, or the 21-year-old computer operator? The answer is obvious. You are not going to take on the retirement costs. You are not going to take on these medical costs. But that is what they continue to tell you up here. The American people are losing these jobs, losing this industry, losing, as a Nation, our economic strength. Superpower--they are ashes in my mouth. You cannot use the nuclear bomb, we all know that. We cannot meet them man for man on manpower. We try to develop our technology, but the truth of the matter is, by the year 2000--Fingleton, read his book ``Blind Side''--they will have a larger economy with 120 million and less than the size of California, compared with our 260 million. They are already our manufacturing superior. Give them 4 more years, and they will have a larger economy than we will have. In 15 years, the People's Republic of China will be ahead of us. We are going the way of England, I can tell you that right now: a second-rate nation with a lot of parliamentary papers and scandalous newspapers, parliamentary maneuvers around here and debate, debate, debate: ``I am concerned,'' ``I am worried,'' ``I am disturbed,'' ``I am concerned,'' ``I am worried,'' and nothing happens. It is all procedural. That sorry contract over there on the House side was all procedural bunk. Term limits, product liability--I can just go down the list of all of those things they had in there. Constitutional amendments--it is like running up in the grandstand like a football team: ``We want a touchdown.'' We are on the field, and we are supposed to balance the budget, but we have to hear all the procedural crap so we can get to the next election and try to get elected and try to hoodwink the people even further. It is time we stop this nonsense and realize--I say to the distinguished Senator from Iowa that I am just as much an agricultural Senator as he is. I got up to WHO in Des Moines, IA. It was 5:30 in the morning. ``No Democrat would appear.'' I did. The first question for me was, ``Senator, how do you expect to get any votes out here in Iowa when you are standing for all the protectionism for the textile industry?'' I said, ``Wait one minute.'' It was a young lady. I said, ``Madam, the truth of the matter is that we don't ask for any protection. What we ask for is protection of our agricultural products. We believe in price supports and import quotas and those Export-Import Bank subsidies. We've got wheat, too, and corn. We've got agricultural products.'' Until I was Governor, we were an agricultural State. Now the majority are in industry today. We have to find technical training and skills, but we think highly of agriculture. So do not think we do not know about agriculture and jobs and wheat. We want to sell it, too, but we have to have a balanced approach to try to maintain America's industrial backbone. So I appreciate the position of the distinguished Senator from Iowa tonight, and I hope he will give me a little bit more notice next time, because I thought once the distinguished Senator from Kansas, the former majority leader, had left us, that that was one problem solved and we could go on and get some other things done. But I can tell you now why that passed before with all of those. We had fast track, no amendments, limited time. When your amendment comes, we will not have fast track, we will have amendments, and we will have unlimited time, and my distinguished senior Senator has set the pace for unlimited time and debate.

She also serves on board of the Farm Bureau Mutual Fund.

Currently, Ann is a board member of the Iowa Department of Economic Development. The list goes on extensively.

10419950097246|A very high percentage of the people are on Medicare. If you just precipitously decide to lop off the money on the health care side, even as you are giving tax cuts to the very affluent and doing a lot of other things we do not need to do and taking it out of the hide of those to whom it means the most, what you end up with is closure of rural hospitals. In North Dakota, I estimate at least a dozen rural hospitals will close rather quickly if we see these kinds of cuts in Medicare without some kind of a plan to reduce the price of health care in a thoughtful way that still allows us to keep a structure out there so we can keep rural hospitals up and open and operating. That is the issue. The issue is how do we get to a balanced budget, not whether. And some in this Chamber want to stop their vehicles at different intersections. They want to stop and give a little tax break to those affluent people in the house on the hill, and then they want to stop at this little house down below and take Medicare funds away from the person who does not have much income, and they want to stop at the next house on that street and take a few dollars away from those who want to send their kids to college. We just have a different system for the delivery truck to get to the destination. We would like to ask everybody to pay their fair share. The point we are making about rural hospitals is a very important point. It applies not just to Nevada but it applies to every State in this country that is a rural State.

10419950104739|Mr. President, I will vote for S. 652, the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995, because a myriad of technological innovations over the past few years have made the current regulatory system obsolete. New rules are needed to acknowledge and encourage competitive innovative technological developments which will enliven the marketplace and offer the consumer greater choice and new technologies. However, these regulatory changes should be done in a way that maintains adequate protections of the public interest. There are several issues that concern me regarding S. 652. My first concern is with the lack of a Department of Justice role in determining when the Baby Bells should be allowed into the long distance market. I believe a specific Department of Justice role is needed to ensure that existing monopoly powers are not used to take advantage of the new markets being entered. It's reasonable that such broad and unprecedented telecommunications deregulation should include reasonable oversight of potentially anticompetitive behavior in an industry where a few giants could control large segments of the various markets. Without a specific Department of Justice role, there is a greater risk that the monopolistic and concentrated businesses will increase and we will not achieve the competition that this bill promises. If this happens, American consumers will be the losers. I supported the Thurmond-Dorgan compromise amendment which would have provided the Attorney General a simultaneous role with the FCC in approving a request by a Bell company to provide long distance service providing that action would not substantially lessen competition, or tend to create a monopoly. Unfortunately, that amendment was not adopted. I hope, therefore, that the House will move to adopt a Department of Justice role so that this issue can be revisited in conference. My second concern regards the cable rate deregulation provisions of the bill. In 1992 Congress passed a comprehensive cable act in response to a strong public outcry about skyrocketing cable rates. This bill undoes much of the good that bill accomplished in slowing down cable rate increases and in many cases reducing cable rates for Americans. This bill deregulates all but the basic tier of cable television and in so doing runs the very real risk of resulting in increased cable rates for Americans which is contrary to what Congress attempted to do just 3 years ago in the 1992 Cable Act. I am also concerned that the bill allows for the preemption of local rules and regulations relating to the management of local rights-of- way. I supported the Feinstein amendment to remove the provision in S. 652 which would preempt local control of the public rights-of-way. Unfortunately, that amendment was defeated. A weaker alternative was accepted which modified but did not eliminate language in the bill allowing for the preemption of local regulations. The Feinstein amendment would have eliminated the preemption capability of the FCC altogether. I believe it is important that we in Congress pay proper recognition to the rights of local government and I am disappointed this bill does not adequate do that. The telecommunications bill before the Senate today will have a huge impact on our economy and on the lives of every single American. I believe the telecommunications reform is both necessary and important. But equally important in that process are the necessary checks and balances to protect consumers and discourage monopolies. While I will vote for this bill because I recognize that telecommunications reform is long overdue and must move forward, I am not convinced this bill contains adequate checks and balances.

10419950115964|Mr. President, I am glad that we are using the criteria that we established in the Readiness Subcommittee on the Armed Services Committee over the last couple of years, the criteria for setting the ground rules for how we move forward on items like this. I must, however, join my friends, Senator McCain and Senator Bingaman, in their concerns about what we are doing. I recognize fully that we did vote for the appropriations bill last week that had these things in it, but it was done on the contingency, as I understand it, that we pass the authorization. Senator Bingaman disapproved of it then and wanted to move that money out of that appropriations bill and into contingency operations. And I supported that amendment of his. Now we have $228 million we seem to have found here. It seems to me that that money would be better spent for what Secretary of Defense Perry has called one of his highest priorities; that is, getting the money to pay for Bosnia and Iraq and the other operations that we have going all around the world. So it would lessen the amount they would have to come up in the supplemental one of these days. The criteria that were established says that if an item is on the FYDP, the 5-year defense plan, that we can move it forward. But one of the hurdles that would have to be jumped would be that one of having it on the 5-year defense plan. As I understand it, all of these items that are on the proposal for the $228 million expenditure do comply with those criteria being on that plan. However, to me, we have so many other things that we are contending with on the defense budget this year. We have depot maintenance that is required. We are shortchanging that. We are shortchanging military housing. We are shortchanging a lot of other things and, in effect, moving these items forward to a higher priority than some of those items. We are moving things forward on what was going to be taken care of somewhere out in the 5-year defense plan. We are moving it forward basically because some Members want these things in their districts, as I see it. And I can appreciate that. I have no quarrel with people wanting things in their particular districts or their particular States. But I just think that we are getting our priorities a little bit out of line when we move things forward on that 5-year defense plan and move them ahead of other requirements that I think are much more pressing than most of the things that this $228 million would be spent for. So I appreciate the fact that we are using the criteria that has been established. I do not think we are setting our priorities right, though, when we move this $228 million ahead of some of the other priorities where money is more desperately needed in the defense budget than for these items. I realize they have already been put through the appropriations process. But I think they are wrong. And I would follow my colleagues earlier and ask that, if this is to be passed on a voice vote--I am not asking for a rollcall vote on this; I do not believe that has been done--but I would follow the lead of Senator Bingaman and say, if there is to be a voice vote, I wish to be recorded against it. I know that will be probably a losing effort. But I think that we have to stand up on some of these things. We have established a pattern in the Armed Services Committee of opposing some of these things the last couple of years. And I would want to do the same thing here even though we did pass the appropriations bill a week or so ago. So I would ask that, if there is a voice vote on this, that I be recorded in opposition.|104506|950802|31|Scr02au95-118 1.txt|563|000617|S11191-S11199|3613|670|OH|John Glenn|S|NA|D

10419950118268|It seems to me, you might be on to something here. We might even finish a bill over here.

Sooner or later we have to finish it. If we do not do it today, then we will be doing it a week from today or sometime. So if we can reach a time agreement, that would certainly help the managers. I do not want to discourage the managers. We can go on to the Interior appropriations bill or we can start the welfare bill today. But I would rather complete this bill before we go to the Interior bill. And there is still some hope we can come back to the Defense authorization bill that we almost completed yesterday and would like to complete today. But I hope that the managers might try to shop around for time agreements, and if not, maybe set aside this particular controversy and go ahead and do the rest of the bill and see if we can negotiate in the meantime.

10419950130344|Mr. President, I would first like to thank my colleague from Delaware, Senator Biden, for crafting and offering this amendment as well as my colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, for his leadership. Mr. President, I want to speak to you today not just as a U.S. Senator, or a citizen of Maine, or even as a Republican. I want to speak to you as a woman, and I want to speak to you on behalf of the 135 million women of America about an issue that has more likely than not touched each of our lives at some point in time. Let me just say that it is not an uncommon occurrence in Congress for either Chamber to authorize funding for a particular program but not to fully fund that program at the authorized levels. It happens often, and, in some circumstances, there may be justifiable reasons to take such a course of action. By not fully funding some wasteful programs, we might even save the taxpayers of America some of their hard earned tax dollars and use them towards programs that work and that make a difference in the daily lives of America's families. But I think it would come as a great surprise to many Americans-- especially to those 135 million women--to know that a program such as the Violence Against Women Act, which was passed as part of last year's crime bill in Congress, has not yet been fully funded. Now, I think it is safe to say that the Violence Against Women Act is one program that deserves its full funding. It is not wasteful. It is not unnecessary. It is not--and should not be--a target of waste watchers. And it is not to be overlooked. But it has been. Fortunately, today, we have an opportunity to correct this oversight. For those who may be wary of its funding--or who may doubt its necessity in this era of penny-pinching and budget scrutiny--let me just take a moment to paint a picture of life in America's streets and homes for some women. It is a picture where more than 2.5 million women annually are victims of violent crimes. It is a picture where an estimated 5,000 women are beaten to death each year. [[Page S 14511]] It is a picture where in the 1990's, one out of every eight women have been the victim of a forcible rape. It is a picture where every 15 seconds in America, a woman is battered--and where every 6 minutes, a woman is raped. It is a picture where, between 1989 and 1993, the number of known rape offenses increased by 11 percent--despite more awareness of violence against women. It is a picture where a woman in our country is more likely to be assaulted, injured, raped, or killed by a male partner than by any other assailant. It is a picture where at least a third of all female emergency room patients are battered women, while a third of all homeless women and children are without shelter because they are fleeing domestic violence. And the litany of tragedy and violence goes on to paint an even fuller, starker, and more disheartening picture. This is an issue about a woman's safety, a woman's rights, and our ability as a nation to protect those inalienable rights as guaranteed under the Constitution. But how can we defend a woman's right to ``life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'' when we cannot protect her from ``rape, battery, and the onslaught of violence.'' Mr. President, the Violence Against Women Act is a critical tool in our fight to combat domestic violence across America. It is an essential bill for our mothers, our daughters, our sisters, our relatives, our friends, and our coworkers. It contains provisions that enhance penalties for sex offenders; provides grants to States to improve law enforcement, prosecution, and victims services in cases of violent crimes against women; authorizes over $200 million for rape prevention and education programs; provides funds for the creation of a national domestic violence hotline as well as battered women's shelters; and does much more. These provisions will help become a shield for women and deliver justice to victims of hateful and brutal assaults. Already, within the past year, two individuals have been imprisoned for life terms under this act for beating their spouses or girlfriends. While I will be the first to say that violence knows no gender barriers and is clearly a threat to both men and women alike, no one can turn a blind eye to the fact that women are especially to be found in the scope of danger and crime. Consider that women are six times--6 times--more likely than men to experience violence committed by an intimate. Consider that women and girls are victimized by relatives at four times the rate of males. And consider that an astounding 95 percent of violence victims are, in fact, women. But the men of America have a stake in this legislation as well, which is why the fight here on the floor has been joined by such men as Senators Biden and Hatch. Namely, the fathers, sons, and brothers of the women of America who face the threat of violence each and every day. They deserve to know that the women who mean the most to them and their lives are safe on the streets of our cities. It is for these reasons that I and 29 of my Senate colleagues requested that we fully fund the Violence Against Women Act in an August 9 letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Violence Against Women Act should be fully funded as it is supposed to be fully paid for out of the crime trust fund that Congress created last year. But the bill before us does not provide for it. Rather, the moneys within the crime trust fund have been what they call ``re-prioritized,'' which in English means that the Violence Against Women Act has been short-changed to the tune of about $75 million. In fiscal year 1995, total funding for this program was $26 million. The House Appropriations Committee appropriated $125 million for the program for fiscal year 1996, and the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee funded $100 million--a threefold increase over current funding, but still far short--woefully short--of what American women need and deserve to combat violence and domestic abuse. Today, we are proposing a remedy to meet this crisis of funding head- on. The amendment offered by the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from Texas provides the additional $75 million needed to fully fund the Violence Against Women Act. Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that--as a former Cochair of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues--I understand and know first-hand the importance of making women's health and women's safety a priority for Congress, because we must speak out for the 135 million women and girls of America. We cannot let them down. We can no longer treat the Violence Against Women Act as a political football and simply fumble away women's needs and concerns. I urge my colleagues to support the Biden-Gramm amendment.|104475|950928|131|Scr28se95-174 1.txt|6974|007088|S14471-S14541|6807|1189|ME|Olympia Snowe|S|NA|R

10419950141341|Madam President, I understand Members may be trying to restate the question by the Senator from Arizona. I will assure the Senator from Arizona and the Democratic leader that when they are getting close to that I will yield immediately for them to make the request again. Basically the point is a very serious point. I do not want to make motions on this or other reconciliation bills. I do so only reluctantly. But this is such a major change in the antitrust law to be tucked in here absent hearings, absent debate, and absent votes. I think is wrong. For those Members of the Senate who are here, when we talked about the Byrd rule in the first place, it was specifically for this. We are talking about a reconciliation bill that goes past the normal debate rules of the Senate. I see the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia on the floor. I think he would be the first to agree regarding this reconciliation. [[Page S 17322]] The budget reconciliation conference report would cast aside the per se rule, and override the Maricopa decision for provider groups and provider-sponsored organizations or PSOs. Members of provider groups, such as doctors, would not be required to share financial risk in order to avoid per se treatment when they collectively set fees at which they provide services. Instead, these loose-knit groups would merely have to meet a checklist of criteria to qualify for the special treatment. None of the group requirements is a substitute for the antitrust law's requirement of meaningful, shared risk. Under the language of the conference report the members need only be part of a group that ``is funded in part by capital contributions made by the members.'' This is no substitute for the shared risk required of a joint venture under antitrust law. Nor would members of PSOs be required to share financial risk under currently governing law in order to avoid per se treatment under traditional analysis. Instead, they are provided their own special antitrust rule in subsection by which ``affiliated'' providers need share, ``directly or indirectly,'' barely a majority financial interest in the PSO. So long as the providers, who would otherwise be competitors, meet the indirect affiliation provisions of the bill, they will be allowed to exchange information ``relating to costs, sales, profitability, marketing, prices, or fees for any health care product or service.'' These provisions each require the antitrust enforcement agencies to conduct a resource-intensive analysis of the ``properly defined market'' in order to challenge conduct that normally would be swiftly condemned as price fixing. Given limited enforcement resources, this change in law inevitably would mean that some anticompetitive activities will go unprosecuted. Could it be that this explains the doctors' lobby's insistence on inclusion of this provision in the conference report? The provisions regarding the provider groups admittedly have to revenue or savings effect for deficit reduction purposes. The provisions regarding the PSOs did not have a score until, miraculously, just before this debate was about to being. Neither set of special rules is integral to Medicare reform. Although defended as a means to encourage provider-sponsored health plans as an alternative to insurers, no such special antitrust treatment is needed to promote Medicare reform. Provider networks already exist without any special antitrust rule. According to industry statistics, 20 percent of all PPOs and 15 percent of all HMOs are provider-owned. A survey by Modern Healthcare showed that in 1994, without a special antitrust rule, over 9 million people were enrolled in provider-owned PPOs. In addition, many other provider- sponsored managed care plans are being developed or planned without the enactment of a special antitrust rule. The Physician Payment Review Commission concluded in its 1995 Report to Congress that the available information did not indicate a significant problem of antitrust laws impeding the development of provider-sponsored managed care plans. The PPRC Report noted press accounts indicating that many physician- sponsored networks are in the process or formation and that ``three- fourths of state medical societies are either contemplating or are actually in the process of establishing physician-sponsored networks.'' Finally, in the past 2 years the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice have issued literally dozens of staff advisory opinions approving the proposed development of provider-sponsored networks. The Senate bill contains no such provisions. In debate on our bill, Senator Frist expressly noted the absence of a Senate provision like proposed section 1853. Senator Hatch spoke to the ``creative tension'' in the health care delivery system involving providers and insurers, and noted Senate consideration of the `` antitrust requirements in current law.'' He concluded that the Senate bill, which had no such special antitrust rule, met the goals of providing real health care choices while making sure that there is accountability. Thus, no special antitrust rule was considered necessary when the Senate debated its Medicare reform package in its budget reconciliation bill a short time ago. These provisions threaten significant injury to competition outside the Medicare program. By allowing competing providers to share information about ``costs, sales, profitability, marketing, prices, or fees'' and to agree on prices in the context of MedicarePlus, the exemption is likely to have the effect of dampening competition among those same providers for non-MedicarePlus business. For this reason among others, special antitrust rules of this type are opposed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Business Coalition on Health, the National Manufacturers Association, the ERISA Industry Committee, the Business Roundtable, the APPWP--The Benefits Association, and the National Association of Attorneys General. No language--and certainly not the fig leaf provided in proposed section 1853, which purports to limit the information exchanged among providers affiliated with a PSO to having not been used for any other purpose than to establish the PSO--can effectively prevent against this spillover effect. Once putative competitors are authorized by statute to share information about ``costs, sales, profitability, marketing, prices'' and fees and to agree on prices for MedicarePlus, they cannot and will not be able to ignore that knowledge they already possess when it comes to setting their prices for others. Providers who agree on prices to be demanded from PSOs or as PSOs may implicitly agree to adhere to similar prices with respect to other activities or moderate their competitive behavior based on the knowledge gained thereby. Once competing providers have met to negotiate their fees, the information they have exchanged and the understandings they have reached would likely spill over into their other dealings and into non-MedicarePlus areas in which health care services ought to be governed by competitive forces. Thus, Gail R. Wilensky, Ph.D., the Chair of the Physician Payment Review Commission, recently testified on September 22, 1995, before the House Ways and Means Committee on Medicare Reform that ``even if a change applies only to the Medicare market, it may be difficult to keep potentially anticompetitive practices from spilling into other markets served by the networks.'' We do not need to enact such provisions and certainly should not do so as part of budget reconciliation. I object and trust my colleagues will not approve such changes in our antitrust laws without proper analysis, justification, study or debate.|104527|951117|60|Scr17no95pt2-90 1.txt|886|001009|S17315-S17330|7737|1198|VT|Patrick Leahy|S|NA|D

10419960000936|If you will be so kind, then why would we want to take any money out of that fund? Why would you not want to, if you are increasing the money from $4,800 to $7,100, I will not dispute that, that there is an increase in that number? I would argue that I do not believe that is going to be enough, based on our experience in Hawaii, and so on. That is my view and some others. I mean, economists have a job explaining to other people why they do not have jobs. Right. So one economist will tell you one thing, and, you know, we are victims of that as much as we are beneficiaries. So why would you want to take any money out of Medicare at this time, $270 billion, $240 billion, whatever it is? Why would we want to take money out? To the degree we want to count savings as a result of tightening up waste, fraud, and abuse, tightening up the amount that we are willing to pay for hospital care or doctor's fees or pharmaceutical needs, et cetera, to the degree there is a savings, let us suppose, again for honest conversation sake, that the $270 billion that is proposed for savings is actually savings, would we not want to have that savings reinvested in the system?

10419960001937|Mr. Speaker, it is always refreshing to hear the comments of my good friend from Massachusetts, and to hear the frustration on that side of the aisle, especially when it comes to the Secretary of the Treasury and his effort to dillydally around with the debt limit, the debt ceiling, being so in love with the notion of keeping the Government operating that he would take pension funds to pay it; an oath of fealty to keeping the Government running instead of being true to the American people. Mr. Speaker, neither side has all the answers, but the fact remains that we must remain true to our country, to our Constitution, and to generations yet unborn by at long last passing a budget that comes into balance in 7 years, using honest numbers. Let us get past frustration and let us see productivity and once again we reach out our hand to the minority party. Join with us and govern this Nation.|104014|960105|1|Hcr05ja96-88 1.txt|18|000032|H308|898|162|AZ|J.D. Hayworth|H|6|R
10419960002549|Let me thank the gentlewoman from Connecticut [Ms. DeLauro] for making certain that this issue is understood more clearly by the American people and by all of those that might think that this is some sort of simple political maneuver that is entirely expected out of those rascals that run Washington, DC, these days. This is a highly unusual and very provocative and extremist tactic that is being employed to bring about the imposition of a particular set of political beliefs by a particular group of Republicans. I think it was interesting that, in the newspapers from Boston Globe to the New York Times and a number of others in today's news reporting, that they reported that Speaker Gingrich just yesterday evening had offered a compromise to allow the debt ceiling issue to be avoided in the Congress. Yet, in all of the discussions that are taking place today on the House floor and among Republicans, we find that there is, in fact, no real agreement among Republicans to, in fact, come to grips with this debt ceiling. I, in fact, debated early this morning with the leader of the movement in the Republican Party, the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Smith], over the issue of the extension of the debt limit. I did not get any sense that he and many other Republicans are now in a process of being willing to compromise on extending the debt limit. Rather, I think that there are a number of Republicans that have signed, in their belief in a contract which requires them to hold the debt limit at its current spending levels in order to impose upon this country the set of beliefs that they ran on when they ran for the Congress of the United States. The truth of the matter is that we have a system in this country which has worked for well over 200 years which does not say that just simply because one gets elected to the Congress that you can impose your set of beliefs on the entire country. We have a process that is set up where you have to get a bill passed by the House of Representatives, passed by the U.S. Senate, if you get it passed by both of those, then you have to get it signed into law by the President. If the President were to sign into law all of the provisions that the Republicans, this extreme group of Republicans, want in their contract, then, in fact, we might be able to go along and have this debt ceiling raised without any controversy. The truth of the matter is there are a number of people in this country that do not believe that we ought to be gutting the Medicare Program, gutting the Medicaid Program, that do not believe that we ought to be doing that at the same time providing an enormous tax cut to the wealthiest people in the Nation. As a result of that specific provision, the Republicans are intending on dumping the entire debt of this Nation and potentially upsetting the whole apple cart of the world's economic finances and the trust that has been established over 200 years or more of history in terms of the United States being the premier creditor Nation in the entire world. So, what essentially is taking place here is very simple. A small group of Republicans have held up the rest of the Republicans and have put a gun to the head of the entire American people and said, ``You either accept our particular belief on how this country ought to move forward or else we are going to, No. 1, not pay our debt.'' OK, we do not pay the first debt that is over $380 billion that is going to come up in the next month. Wall Street has told us that if that debt is defaulted on, we can expect a minimum rise of 1 percent in our borrowing cost. A 1 percent borrowing cost increase for anybody with an adjustable rate mortgage is going to cost them $1,200 a year. Now, the entire tax break that the Republicans are insistent upon in order to get this is not even worth $1,200 a year. So they are going to give away more to interest rate increases than they are going to get out of the tax break. This is the most ludicrous proposition that one could possibly design. President Clinton has reached out to the Republicans and said that he will in fact come up with a 7-year balanced budget, with a CBO balanced budget; he will do it with cuts. What he will not do is go beyond the cuts that are required to get to a balanced budget and actually provide an enormous tax break, the lion's share of which goes to the wealthiest people in this country. It is a principled position. It is a reasonable thing to believe in in this country, a system of government that has been set into place, that does not allow an extremist view to come in and impose itself upon the rest of the Nation. Those differences are what we are elected to then work out a reasonable compromise. We have a system of this country that allows that compromise to move forward. What we ought not to do is sit back and allow the imposition of a particular viewpoint to be rammed down the throat of the rest of the Nation while we sit back and diddle. I believe that it is important for us to have this debate. It is important for us to make certain that the American public understands that if in fact we go ahead and default on this debt, that this is not a tactic that anybody, many Republicans, John Kasich included, have ever endorsed. I would ask John Kasich and I would ask other moderate Republicans to join with over 150 Democrats that in just 1 day have signed a clean discharge petition. All you have to do is walk up to that front desk. Ask the clerk to provide you, they will even give you a pen. They will give you that pen. You put your name to the paper, and we can make this issue go away, provide the credit of this country with the service that it needs and provide this country with the kind of compromise solution that has worked for over 200 years of American history.

We are hearing a lot about what this bill is and what it is not. I think one of our former Presidents once said, ``Education is expensive, but ignorance is even more expensive.'' This bill is about educating the American people. It is not about mandating the States. It is about getting information out to the people about what the gaming industry and the gambling is doing to our small businesses and our families and our wages. That is what this is about. I recommend the ``Luck Business'', by Robert Goodman, to see some of the devastating consequences that gaming is having in our small communities. Second, this is about values. Our values in American society are not to say to our children, ``Go out and win the lottery. We are going to go out to 7-Eleven and buy enough tickets and go gaming and gambling, and that is the way to make the American dream.'' It is about hard work and sacrifice and commitment. So let us study and see what this proliferation of gambling is having on American families and American small businesses. That is all this bill does.|104144|960305|37|Hcr05mr96-94 1.txt|1326|001347|H1675-H1687|1242|223|IN|Tim Roemer|H|3|D

10419960019840|Mr. Chairman, let me talk about the Jackson- Lee amendment for a few minutes, and I think the Members who are here and who are watching it now realize that we are talking about authorization bill here. The Committee on Appropriations has already appropriated $600 million more than this bill authorizes, and what we are trying to do with my colleagues from Houston, Ms. Jackson-Lee's amendment, is to provide $81.5 million in additional authorization to make sure we do not have as much as 3 weeks' furlough of the employees there. That is really not a way to run a government, a business, or an airline, or a railroad, or anything else where we plan to authorize less than what we are going to spend so we can lay off those workers there because we are not planning for it. Again, it does not make any sense because all we are doing is authorizing, we are not spending a penny with this bill today. The Committee on Appropriation and the appropriations bill will spend the penny; we are just authorizing them to do it. And since they have already come up with $600 million more, again my colleagues may disagree with that, well, then let us talk to the Committee on Appropriations. But NASA has already downsized and done everything they can. NASA has already downsized, and they have become leaner, meaner. In fact, whether it be the administration or those of us in Congress who have made them provide a better value for the American taxpayer, they have cut 4,000 civil service jobs since 1993 and plan to continue to cut another 4,000 by the fiscal year 2000. And the reduction in work force will not generate the savings for this coming year because NASA cannot technically execute a reduction in work force or a RIF, one early enough to generate that savings even if it is not authorized. That is what I think we need to go back to, and from what I understand, this $81.5 million that is needed for the authorization to make sure that we do not have that furlough of those employees, these are full-time NASA employees where planning but not authorizing funding for them, to furlough them for 10 to 12 to 21 days sometime during the year. Again that is not the way anybody should run their business, and we should not expect the Government to run that way either because we are just authorizing it today. The future of our work force depends on the high-skilled and the skilled jobs that the space station, the aerospace industry provides, and again we should not treat those employees, whether they are NASA or whether they are contract, in saying, ``Well, we've sorry we're going to lay you off for 21 days because we don't have the authorization to spend the money even though one hand we could do it, but on the other hand we are not giving it to you.'' That just does not make any sense.|104397|960530|90|Hcr30my96-99 1.txt|985|001028|H5674-H5724|2798|505|TX|Gene Green|H|29|D

10419960026629|Mr. Speaker, if the Federal Trade Commission had jurisdiction over our legislative processes, I think that this would probably be cited as a bait and switch proposition. I read the resolution and it consists largely of a number of very good reasons why we should not do favors for and make concessions to and trade on these terms with the Chinese People's Republic. It is a long list of the great grievances which we have against the Chinese People's Republic. Then we come into the last page, in which, having shaken our fist at them and listed all the terrible things we do, we unleash our weapon: Hearings. Now, I appreciate the fact that hearings can sometimes be a nuisance if you are the Secretary of an American Cabinet department. The notion that we are going to have hearings might be a problem. but the threat of hearings in this situation seems to me to be of quite minimal effect on the Chinese. So I would have to say, and I will yield to the gentleman if he would yield me some of his time, because I only have 2 minutes and he had 8 and some odd minutes left, but at this point I would say it does appear to me that any resemblance between this and a serious piece of legislation is entirely coincidental. The notion that the Chinese, having compiled this very long record of violating agreements and abusing people and getting the better of us economically, would really be upset because we are going to have hearings seems to me to be quite minimal. If the gentleman wants to yield some time, I will be glad to have a colloquy with him, but apparently he does not, so I will simply say that this may ease the conscience of those who voted for MFN. If in fact Members agree with everything in this resolution, I do not know how they could have voted to give the Chinese Most-Favored-Nation treatment. There is certainly nothing, I will say in closing, in the behavior, in the record, in the composition of the People's Republic of China that ought to give anybody the slightest inclination to believe that the Chinese will pay any more attention to this than they have anything we ever did before.|104187|960627|33|Hcr27jn96pt2-47 1.txt|1227|001261|H7027-H7040|2113|385|MA|Barney Frank|H|4|D
10419960027683|Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, within the Violence Against Women Act programs is a special program that is very dear to me and the people of the eighth District of Michigan. I am referring to the battered women's shelter programs administered through the Department of Health and Human Services. Although the committee has increased the dollars for battered women's shelters, my amendment would give the program an additional $2.4 million to fully fund the program at the President's request. In my home town in Michigan, the LACASA women's shelter provides hundreds of abused women and their children shelter, food, and counseling. For many years, my wife Katie and I have worked arm in arm with the dedicated workers and volunteers of LACASA to find the scarce resources to keep their shelter operations continue. I am now in a position to do more as a congressman, and I intend to. It's time for this abuse to stop. These women and children need our help, and they need our help now because there is simply no tomorrow for some of them. Even with the hard work and dedication of groups like LACASA that are working for women around the country, the need for more services and more Federal dollars continues to increase. In Michigan, for instance, the nights of shelter provided each year to abused women has increased 23 percent since 1991. However, even with these increased services in Michigan, the number of domestic violence victims denied shelter since 1991 has increased 25 percent. This is one area of service where it seems we cannot do enough. When abused women and children need to get themselves out of terribly abusive relationships, they need to act quickly. We must provide a secure safehouse for battered women and their children. We must provide for them today. My amendment takes another step forward to provide all the help we can to the women and children who most need it. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support my amendment to fully fund the battered women's shelter programs within the Violence Against Women Act.|104201|960710|91|Hcr10jy96-60 1.txt|2348|002382|H7220-H7243|2062|352|MI|Dick Chrysler|H|8|R

10419960030700|Madam Chairman, I thank my ranking member for yielding the time to me. I say over and over again, this is a flawed bill. It is not hard to see it. They are wrapping it in politics to try and save the fact that there is no substance in this bill that is going to save the children of this country. Everything I have heard from the majority side makes me know they have never, ever experienced welfare. Now they are beginning to try to reform it. I want to reform it. I know it needs to be reformed. But it does not have to be reformed on the backs of the children of this country. It does not have to be reformed on food stamps. And they are having a similar idea that people who get food stamps, AFDC, do not know how to choose their food. That is not correct. The same Members who feel that way are the ones who drafted this bill. This bill is going to deny 300,000 children of legal immigrants from getting food stamps. Do they want to cut children off from food? They have said they have a family-friendly atmosphere in the Republican Party. This does not meet the test of family-friendly. Until yesterday they have changed back and forth so much, it is hard. I have not seen this new language. But yesterday their bill prohibited benefits and vouchers. Now they have switched over and now they are making that, they are putting that in, but they are not requiring it. They are not fooling me, because they are making it permissive. They cannot do it or they may do it. Why not say, as our bills do, that they will be required to provide vouchers to these children who will go off Medicaid? My colleagues have exceeded the limits of care and sympathy and compassion which this Congress is supposed to give to the American people. They are not fooling the American people by saying this is a good welfare bill. We all want to reform welfare. Why can we not get together, both Republicans and Democrats, put our heads together and reform this without having a one-sided view toward Medicare and toward welfare? I say to my colleagues, turn this bill back. I do not blame the President of the United States. Every time we send him a bad bill, he should veto it, no matter how many times.|104100|960718|58|Hcr18jy96-63 1.txt|755|000790|H7796-H7846|2187|410|FL|Carrie P. Meek|H|17|D

They have stalled the review process on a complaint about Speaker Gingrich to such an extent that now they may not even address the allegations at all before we adjourn this year. Exactly what does the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct do, if it will not report on findings? What is in the report that they do not want the American people to see it? The investigation has so far cost the American people half a million dollars. I think these same taxpayers, as well as Mr. Gingrich's own constituents in Georgia, deserve to know if the allegations are true or false. If the Republicans on the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct plan to adjourn before addressing this complaint, the least they should do is release the report from the outside counsel.

10419960038712|Mr. Speaker, this debate is not about abortion on demand in the 7th, 8th, or 9th month. Roe versus Wade and the law of the land allows for States to make that procedure illegal. So the specter of perfect babies being killed moments before they draw their first breaths is irrelevant to the discussion here today and are being used as a way to inflame the rhetoric and cloud the debate. What we are fighting about today is whether or not we should have a specific provision in the law allowing when the mother's life or health is threatened, that this procedure be available. We have started this debate with a picture. I wonder about some other pictures. Where is the picture of these moms who are for the most part older, married, have other children, are in the pregnancy that is desperately wanted, celebrated, with babies' rooms already decorated, tiny little clothes already purchased? Where is the picture of the agony that these families go through, cry through, pray through over the promise of a pregnancy that will never be fulfilled? Where is the picture of the horrible second guessing, the terrible hoping against hope that some sort of miracle is going to save this baby that can never live, all the while the mother knows that her health or her ability to have another baby could very much be in jeopardy? Where is the picture of mothers like Tammi Watts who weeped when asked the question, do you have any other children? She said, well, I have one baby in heaven. That is not a woman who would cheerfully end a baby's life moments before it would draw its first breath. Do not believe the discussion we are hearing today. Look at the pictures. Look at the facts. The debate is whether or not we will allow a woman's health to be an exemption from this law. One side says no, our side says yes. Get the real picture.|104206|960919|64|Hcr19se96-86 1.txt|1831|001859|H10608-H10620|1832|331|MI|Lynn N. Rivers|H|13|D

10419960045109|Mr. President, I yield to myself such time as I may require on this amendment. I rise to offer an amendment to the Agriculture Reform and Improvement Act of 1996. In July 1995, the Agriculture Committee gave preliminary, but unanimous, approval to four titles of the farm bill. They covered farm credit, trade, rural development, and research. Since then, there has been further bipartisan work on a miscellaneous title and an agriculture promotion title. I present the fruits of those labors to the Chamber today. The Government's role in agricultural lending is substantial. This amendment provides direction to USDA to focus on helping beginning farmers and ranchers to get started and progress in farming and ranching. The amendment emphasizes that the USDA's assistance is temporary, and, most importantly, it modifies or ends a variety of risky farm loan policies which the committee considered during hearings this year. The amendment will expand and maintain our presence in overseas markets for high-value and bulk commodities. It establishes measurable benchmarks to evaluate U.S. export performance programs, including dollar value and market share growth goals. In addition, increased flexibility in the operation of export credit programs will allow us to seize future opportunities. We know that all leadership is local. Rural businesses and communities cannot sustain themselves without first taking a hard look at the human capital and resources at their disposal. This amendment provides for a new rural program delivery mechanism that depends on local and State leadership and consolidates over a dozen duplicate programs. The amendment also address the vital role that agricultural research, extension, and education play in ensuring a productive, efficient and competitive agricultural sector in our Nation. Research is the foundation for agriculture's future success. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment which will bring agricultural policy into the 21st century. Mr. President, this amendment also contains a number of miscellaneous provisions supported by various Senators. We are not aware that these are controversial. Among them are provisions to set oilseed loan rates according to a market-based formula, proposed by Senator Moseley-Braun; to provide equitable treatment for beginning farmers under the Agricultural Market Transition Program, proposed by Senator Pressler; and numerous other amendments. I ask unanimous consent that a description of these provisions be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:|104462|960207|78|Scr07fe96-9 1.txt|1624|001720|S1001-S1060|2623|396|IN|Richard Lugar|S|NA|R

10419960051321|Mr. President, I will use my leader time Mr. President, I think it would be very unfortunate if someone cast this as anything other than what it is--unless we act soon, we will be at the lowest point in terms of purchasing power that we have been in our Nation's history when it comes to the minimum wage. That is a fact. This is not an effort to encumber an environmental bill, as troubling as one aspect of that bill is. It has nothing to do with Presidential politics, it has nothing to do with labor unions. It has everything to do with the fact that the economic foundation for working families in this country has been, is now, and will continue to be the minimum wage. That is a fact. A fair minimum wage is an economic foundation for working families, period. Seventy-three percent of those who would benefit from this minimum wage increase are adults. Almost three out of every four people; not just those getting started in life, or just out of high school or college. They are people struggling to make ends meet with a family. And 40 percent of those on minimum wage today are the sole breadwinners. Let us put an end to the stereotype of the teenager flipping hamburgers so he can buy a car, or somehow get started right out of school. The face of a typical minimum wage worker is a woman working full time or part time to support her family, a single mother working 40 hours a week, and concluding at the end of every week or month when she tries to pay the bills that she is still living in poverty. A minimum wage increase could help, at long last, after 5 years, pull her at least a little bit out of the depths of concern that she has about the economic and financial problems she is facing. A 90-cent increase, which is what this bill would do, provides $1,800 more in a year's time. And 45 cents does not sound like a whole lot, but when you combine 45 cents this year and next, over a period of time you find that it buys more than 7 months worth of groceries, 1 year of health care, including insurance premiums, prescription drugs, and other out- of-pocket costs. This increase will buy 4 months rent or mortgage payments. This increase pays 9 months of utility bills. So do not let anybody mislead you. This is not just a minuscule amount for a lot of people. This is whether people can eat or have the ability to pay their bills. That is what we are talking about here. The increase in the minimum wage is obviously just a piece of it. The earned-income tax credit is also a very important part. We have faced, throughout this last 14 months, efforts by many of our Republican colleagues to cut the earned-income tax credit. They tell us that they ought to go out and find a job, they do not need the EITC, they ought to rely on the marketplace to find, somehow, an increase in wages there. If we are going to rely upon the marketplace, we better have a living wage to do that. The minimum wage can only be the beginning for many of these working families. Republicans often tell us they want to move people off welfare and on to work, and we share that view, that desire, that goal. What do you tell people who work 40 hours a week and are still below the legal level of poverty in this country? How is that an encouragement to tell people to get off welfare? Restoring the minimum wage to a working wage is one of the best ways you get people off of welfare. Five years, Mr. President, is a long time. In that 5 years, we have had increases in our wages. Just about every CEO in this country has seen dramatic increases in their wages. I do not deny them that. In many cases, they truly deserve it. On April 1, we will see the fifth anniversary of the last increase in the minimum wage. We have seen a 20-year period of wage stagnation, and the gap between the richest and poorest in this country has never been wider. The stratification in this country has to be something this Senate addresses. A higher minimum wage is the least we can do to begin dealing effectively with that stratification. The real value of the minimum wage has fallen by nearly 50 cents since 1991, and by 29 percent since 1979. If we do not act right now, the real value will be at a 40-year low by January 1997. This is not just a matter affecting a few people, Mr. President; 12 million working people will benefit directly by what we are going to decide this afternoon. In 32 States, it is over 10 percent of the work force. In study after study, in spite of all the denials you hear from our Republican friends--nearly two dozen in all, not one or two--have shown that a moderate increase in the minimum wage can be achieved without costing jobs. That is not our assertion. That is not something we just postulate about. This is something that actually has been examined in case after case after case, and in every single case it has been reported that you can raise the minimum wage at a moderate level and not cost jobs. In fact, we see a positive effect on both business and workers. A higher minimum wage reduces turnover, raises productivity, and lowers recruitment and training costs. When workers are paid better, when they get a better living wage, then there is more demand for the products they make. There are all kinds of advantages in doing this in a proper way. We know that. Apparently, a lot of Republican colleagues share that view because the last time we voted in 1989, 89 Senators supported the increase in the minimum wage. A Republican President signed it into law indicating that he endorsed the principle of a guaranteed and fair minimum wage. The time has come to show that same bipartisanship and to do it again. A recent Gallup poll said that 77 percent of the American people think that we ought to do it again. Sixty-three percent of Republicans think that we ought to do it again. This is not a ``new mandate.'' This is not something that we have just dreamed up. This is something we have been doing for decades and decades with the realization you have to start somewhere. The U.S. Conference of Mayors just sent us all a letter that makes it very clear that they endorse an increase in the minimum wage. These are government leaders at the most local level telling us that they see what this does; they know that if we get people off welfare, they can reduce the cost of government. The way to do it is with a minimum wage that works. So, Mr. President, there are those who say we are somehow encumbering the process. So be it. If there is no other way to ensure that we get a vote on the minimum wage, we have no other choice but to do it this way. We have all agreed that we will hold off on offering this as an amendment to any other piece of legislation if we can simply get a timeframe within which this can be debated, when we can consider it in a way that gives us a commitment to vote on a minimum wage. The ultimate irony is that the majority is asking people making $4.25 an hour to wait until the majority figures out a way to cut their Medicare benefits before they allow them a 45-cent increase. Republicans--at least some of them--are prepared to wage a war on working families. Two days ago, we saw that they are willing to go to any length to avoid a vote and to face a choice. We saw a 4-hour quorum call, a motion to recommit, a recess in one of the biggest weeks of the year, and talk of an unfunded mandates points of order. Mr. President, never have so few done so much to deny so little to so many. Working Americans are not going to be fooled. Our Republican colleagues cannot have it both ways. They express newfound concern for workers in a campaign but then manufacture reasons to oppose them when it is real. If you oppose the minimum wage, as the House majority leader does, then vote against this. But if you believe that 12 million people--many the sole earners for their families--deserve an increase, then vote for it. The time to face up to that choice is what this is all about. It is what we were elected to do. Let us do it this afternoon. Several Senators addressed the Chair.|104520|960328|42|Scr28mr96-138 1.txt|1153|001282|S3091-S3100|8053|1504|SD|Tom Daschle|S|NA|D

10419960054201|Mr. President, I do thank my friend from Colorado. This Senate will miss him, and certainly I will miss him. He is a very special friend and one for whom I have come to have the highest respect and admiration and affection. I want to thank Senator Shelby. Such a fine ally. I admire him so, a very steady, thoughtful, extremely authentic man when he deals with the issues of the day. I just say to my friend from Colorado that I think my colleague from Michigan was a bit shocked when the Senator said we were talking about joining these issues. My amendment is not about joining the issues. I want to express that. This is a singular amendment based upon the majority recommendations from the Jordan commission. We have seen fit to see that it is an issue that will be discussed, voted on, whichever way it goes, and then move on. I think once we finish this amendment, things will move in a swifter fashion. But just let me say this to kind of summarize some things that have occurred during the debate. Please understand that I think what my friend, Senator Feingold, was talking about--parents--there is no change in my amendment in the definition of ``immediate family,'' none. Parents, minor children, spouses, no change. That, I think, is unfortunate; and perhaps it may have been misconstrued. But there is no change in the definition of ``immediate family'' in what I am doing. I say, too, that in the debate I have heard the phrase that these people come here to work. I agree with that totally. There was another reference to the fact that they are a tremendous burden on the United States. I have never shared that view. I have never shared the view that these people who come here are a tremendous burden. But there are some touching stories here I just have to comment on. You knew that I would not completely allow that to slip away. We can all tell the most touching stories that we can possibly conjecture. My friend from Ohio tells those stories. My friend from Massachusetts tells those stories. I can tell those stories, for I have a brother who is just about the most wonderful man you can ever imagine. I would like to have him here. But the problem is, nobody will raise the numbers, no one will come to this floor and say, ``I think legal immigration should be 1,000,002.'' I do not know of anybody who is going to come here and do that. Unless you do that, then I have to make a choice, which is not quite as dramatic as Sophie's choice. That would be a poor illustration. But I have to decide whether I want to bring my spouse and minor children or my brother or raise the numbers. That is where we are. So you either deal with the priorities or you lift the numbers. There is not much place to go. When Senator DeWine talks about this gutsy guy, this gutsy, hard- working guy--and that I will remember for a long time because I know that story now--that gutsy, hard-working guy cannot come here, ladies and gentlemen, because 78 percent of the visas have been used by family connection. This gutsy, hard-working guy, the people we all think about when we talk about immigration, these people who come and enrich our Nation, as memorialized on the Statue of Liberty by Emma Lazarus, are not going to get here, ladies and gentlemen, because 78 percent of the visas are used by family connection, period. That is where we are. You take more or give more. I have the view, which is consistent, that we ought to give the precious numbers to the closest family member. That is the purpose of my amendment. Senator Kennedy talks about the adult child who will have to wait, and it is a poignant story--or the only sister of the Cambodian who will not be able to come for 5 years. I ask my colleagues if you really prefer to admit brothers and sisters or adult children while husbands and wives and minor children are standing in line, who want to join their family here, who can be described as ``little kids,'' ``little mothers, little fathers.'' That is what this is. What kind of a policy is that? I tell you what kind of a policy it is, it is our present policy. The present policy of the United States is that there is a backlog on spouses and minor children of permanent resident aliens, which is 1.1 million. There is a backlog of brothers and sisters in that fifth preference, of 1.7 million people. No one is going to wait that long, I can assure you. No one is going to wait that long. They will come here. Who would not? There are two choices: Raise the numbers, or give true priorities. There is no other choice. None. Americans will not put up with the first one, which is to raise the numbers. You can see what they say. They do not want new numbers. The Roper Polls, the Gallup Polls down through the years, ever since I have been in this issue, ask the people of America, do they want to limit illegal immigration. The response is ``Yes,'' 70 to 75 percent. And the second question, do you want to limit legal immigration, and the answer is ``Yes,'' 70 percent consistently throughout my entire time in the U.S. Senate. You cannot do both. You cannot lower numbers and keep the current naturalization system, so you have to raise the numbers or else go to a true priority. There is nothing about persons, human beings, and all the rest of that. That is one we can all tell. It is about if you really care, if you really, really care about what we are all saying here, then raise the numbers. If you want to do that, we should have that debate--raise the numbers. If you do not raise the numbers, you are going to continue to see a 40-year-old brother of a U.S. citizen taking away the number of a spouse, a little spouse or a minor child, a tiny child--we can all do that. That is why we do not get much done and probably will not get much done here. At least we will have a vote. That is what this is about. What about my spouse and minor children that I love? Why not both of them? Why cannot my spouse, minor children and my brother come? It is because they will not raise the figures. Raise the figures and then they can all come. Make your choice. I can tell you, in grappling with this issue and all the issues of emotion, fear, guilt, and racism--I keep using it again and again and again--and Emma Lazarus, I know all about Emma Lazarus. I read up on that remarkable woman years ago. Of course, the Statue of Liberty does not say, ``Send us everybody you have, legally or illegally.'' That is not what it says. The most extraordinary part of it all is that the people who want to do everything with illegal immigrants and do something to ``punish them'' and do something to limit them and do something here, here and there, are the very people who will also not allow us to do anything with a proper verification system that will enable us to get the job done. We will have a debate on that one and see where that goes. That is an amendment of mine on verification. You cannot do anything in the illegal immigration bill unless you do something with the gimmick documents of the United States. When we try to do that one, here comes wizards like the Cato Institute talking about tattoos and people who have found an enclave there, to reign down and give us no answers, not a single answer about what you do with illegal immigration, if you do not do something with the documents, verification or the gimmick Social Security and the gimmick driver's licenses and all the rest. What a bunch. What a bunch. I am still waiting for the editorial from one of their wizards over there to pour out for me what happened to the slippery slope here. When I go to the airport and get asked by the baggage clerk for a picture ID, I did not really think about that being the slippery slope, but I guess it must be the slickest slope we can ever imagine if this other stuff is the slippery slope. This is bizarre. Get asked by a baggage clerk for a picture ID will not do something to keep illegal, undocumented people out of the United States and keep them from working in the United States so the American citizens can have the job and do the work. It is a curious operation, but things I needed to say. That is why this amendment is here. We will just see where it goes. Let her rip. Somebody can come and look at what the debate was and say, ``How did it ever reach that point? Hundreds of thousands of people playing by the rules will have to wait?'' Under the current system which would be perpetuated by the present committee language, 1.1 million spouses and children of permanent residents, must wait for up to 5 years. While the closest families members are waiting for years, now we admit under our current system 65,000 siblings of citizens and their families every single year. Finally, Barbara Jordan did know about the figures that have been presented in this debate. The INS statistics, their division of statistics sent one of their experts to the commission to help with their deliberations, to help the commission, and they certainly did know about these figures. The magnitude is alarming, but they knew. So the important link between legal and illegal immigration, many of those we are often told are waiting patiently in the backlog and some in fact are not waiting patiently in the backlog. In fact, they are not waiting at all. Why should they? They have entered this country legally or illegally. Legally they are residing here. When their place on the backlog is reached they apparently feel a sense of entitlement there because their visa has been approved. They say, ``Gosh, I have been approved to come to the United States of America, but I cannot come for 10 or 15 years because some brother is taking up the slot. Some 30-, 40-year-old brother down the road has taken my slot and I want to be with my spouse and minor children or some closer relative, an unmarried son, a daughter, a married son or daughter.'' But no, because we have this huge line of preferences and we meet them all and we are required to meet them all with a total of 226,000 people. We are required to do that. They certainly feel they have a technical ability to come here. How many are in that group? Let me tell you how many are in that group--1 million people in that group. Let me tell you who are these people waiting to come in who are currently in the United States who are not playing by the rules. Here are people who are, I hope my colleagues will hear, who are not playing by the rules. We have in the family first preference, the estimated percent of people, waiting list applicants, who are currently in the United States, should not be in the United States, but are in the United States because they have been approved, but they have not been approved for entry. But they are here. Mr. President, 25 percent are in the family first category. Sixty-five percent of spouses and children in the family second category are not playing by the rules. They are here. Where do you think they would be? They have been approved. They are on the list, and they have not been finally adjudged, and they are here, and 65 percent are not playing by the rules. Adult sons and daughters, 25 percent are not playing by the rules. Third preference, 8 percent. Family, 5 percent--all not playing by the rules. I will enter into the Record that estimate of the waiting list and family sponsored preferences as of February 1996. I ask unanimous consent that that be printed. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: ESTIMATED IV--WAITING LIST IN THE FAMILY-SPONSORED PREFERENCES AS OF Family first........................ 80,000 69,540 +10,460 Family second: Spouses/children.................. 1,140,000 1,138,544 +1,456 Adult sons/daughters.............. 550,000 494,064 +55,936 Family third........................ 285,000 260,414 +24,586 Family fourth....................... 1,700,000 1,592,424 +107,576|104537|960425|38|Scr25ap96-211 1.txt|3003|003191|S4116-S4150|11884|2146|WY|Alan K.

10419960056512|Madam President, many Americans don't have the slightest idea about the enormity of the Federal debt. Ever so often, I ask groups of friends, how many millions of dollars are there in a trillion? They think about it, voice some estimates, most of them wrong. One thing they do know is that it is the U.S. Congress that has run up the enormous Federal debt that is now over $5 trillion. To be exact, as of the close of business yesterday, May 6, 1996, the total Federal debt--down to the penny--stood at $5,090,257,303,263.75. Another sad statistic is that on a per capita basis, every man, woman, and child in America owes $19,223.62. So Madam President, how many million are there in a trillion? There are a million million in a trillion, which means that the Federal Government owes more than five million million dollars. Sort of boggles the mind, doesn't it?|104502|960507|1|Scr07my96-171 1.txt|16|000030|S4801|862|151|NC|Jesse Helms|S|NA|R
10419960057005|Mr. President, it has been kind of an interesting couple of days in the Senate, and I noticed in the newspaper this morning in the headlines the word ``gridlock,'' which I am sure will please some in this Chamber, because yesterday they were trying to persuade the press to use the word ``gridlock.'' They said what is happening in the Senate is gridlock. What happened yesterday was quite interesting. Those who suggest this is gridlock in the Senate came to the floor of the Senate yesterday, offered a piece of legislation and then, prior to any debate beginning on that legislation, the same people who offered the legislation filed a cloture motion to shut off debate that had not yet begun on a piece of legislation that had been offered only a minute before. Someone who does not serve in the Senate or does not understand the Senate rules might scratch their head and say, ``How on Earth could someone do that with a straight face? How could someone, without laughing out loud, offer a piece of legislation before debate begins, file cloture to shut off debate on a piece of legislation they have just now filed, and then claim that the other side is guilty of causing gridlock?'' Only in the Senate can that be done without someone laughing out loud at how preposterous that claim is. This is not gridlock. It is more like a gag rule, where you bring a piece of legislation to the Senate because you control the Senate floor and you say, ``Here's what we want to do, and, by the way, we're going to use parliamentary shenanigans to fill up the parliamentary tree so no one has an opportunity to offer any amendments of any kind, and then we are going to file a motion to shut off debate before you even get a chance to debate.'' No, that is not gridlock, that is a gag rule. From a parliamentary standpoint, it can be done. It was not done when the Democrats were in control in the 103d Congress. We never did what is now being done on the floor of the Senate: filling the legislative tree completely and saying, ``By the way, you have no opportunity, those of you who feel differently, to offer amendments.'' But we will work through this, and we will get beyond this. I will say to those who claim it is gridlock, it is clear the Senate is not moving and the Senate is not acting, but at least the major part of that, it seems to me, is because we have people who decide that it is going to be their agenda or no agenda, and they insist on their agenda without debate, their agenda without amendments. What we have are three proposals that have been ricocheting around the Chamber the last couple of days, and there is a very simple solution. We have a proposal called the minimum wage. Many of us feel there ought to be some kind of adjustment in the minimum wage. It has been 5 years. Those working at the bottom of the economic ladder have not had a 1-penny increase in their salaries. Many of us feel there ought to be some adjustment there. The second issue is, the majority leader wants to cut or reduce the gas tax by 4.3 cents a gallon. And the third issue is a labor issue called the TEAM Act. The way to solve this, instead of linking them together in Byzantine or strange ways, is simply to bring all three measures to the floor one at a time, allow amendments to be offered and then have an up-or-down vote. This is not higher math; it is simple arithmetic. Bring the bills to the floor. Our side has no interest, in my judgment, in filibustering on any of those bills, at least not that I am aware of. I do not think we ought to filibuster any of those bills. Bring the bills to the floor, have a debate, entertain amendments, have a final vote, and the winner wins. That is not a very complicated approach. It is the approach that would solve this problem. I listened carefully yesterday to a speech on the Senate floor that was essentially a campaign speech--hard, tough, direct. It was a Presidential campaign speech. You have a right to do that on the Senate floor. I do not think it advances the interests of helping the Senate do its business. I almost felt during part of that speech yesterday there should be bunting put up on the walls of the Senate, perhaps some balloons, maybe even a band to put all this in the proper perspective. The Senate is not going to be able to do its work if it becomes for the next 6 months a political convention floor. I hope that we can talk through that in the coming days and decide the Senate is going to have to do its work. We have appropriations bills we have to pass. We have other things to do that are serious business items on the agenda of this country. I do not think that we can do this if the Senate becomes the floor of a political convention from now until November. I want to speak just for a moment about the proposed reduction in the gasoline tax. Gasoline prices spiked up by 20 to 30 cents a gallon recently. When gasoline prices spiked up and people would drive to the gas pumps to fill up their car, they were pretty angry about that, wondering, ``What has happened to gasoline prices?'' Instead of putting a hound dog on the trail of trying to figure out who did what and why, what happened to gas prices, immediately we had some people come to the floor of the Senate and say, ``OK, gas prices spiked up 20, 30 cents a gallon. Let's cut the 4.3-cent gas tax put on there nearly 3 years ago.'' I do not understand. I guess the same people, if they had a toothache, would get a haircut. I do not see the relationship. Gas prices are pushed up 20 to 30 cents so they are going to come and increase the Federal deficit by cutting a 4.3-cent gas tax. I would like to see lower gas taxes as well, but I am not going to increase the Federal deficit. The Federal deficit has been cut in half in the last 3 years. Why? Because some of us had the courage to vote for spending decreases and, yes, revenue increases to cut the deficit in half. The central question I have is this: If you cut the gas tax, who gets the money? There are a lot of pockets in America. There are small pockets, big pockets, high pockets, and low pockets. You know who has the big pockets and small pockets. The oil industry always had the big pockets. The driver has always had the small pockets. Guess what? When you take a look at what is going to happen when you see a gas tax reduction and have some people talk to the experts, here is what you find. This is yesterday's paper: ``Experts say gas tax cut wouldn't reach the pumps. Oil industry called unlikely to pass savings on to consumers.'' Energy expert Philip Verleger says: The chairman of ARCO company says: He said: He said: The majority leader's aides in the paper today said they had: An Amoco Corp. spokesperson said: Mobil Corp. said: The point is this gas tax reduction sounds like an interesting thing, but if you take $3 billion out of the Federal Government and increase the deficit, which you will do--I think the so-called offset is a sham--but increase the Federal deficit, take $3 billion, put it in the pockets of the oil industry and the drivers are still going up to the same pumps paying the same price for their gas, who is better off? The taxpayer? No. Is the Federal deficit better off? No, that is higher. The oil industry is better off. I guess my hope is that we will decide for a change here in the U.S. Senate to do the right thing. The right thing, it seems to me, is for us to proceed on the agenda. Yes, the majority leader and the majority party have the majority, they have the right to proceed down the line on their agenda. We are 47 Members in the minority. We are not pieces of furniture. We are people that have an agenda we care deeply about. We also intend to exercise our right in the Senate to offer amendments and to try to affect the agenda of the Senate. For those who say we have no right to offer amendments, that we will be thwarted in any attempt at all to offer our agenda, we say it will be an awfully long year because we intend to advance the issue of the minimum wage. The minimum wage ought to be adjusted. People at the top rung of the economic ladder have a 23-percent increase in the value of their salaries and their stock benefits last year; the people at the bottom of the economic ladder, those people out there working for minimum wage, have for 5 years not received a one-penny increase, and lost 50 cents of the value of their minimum wage. We are not asking to spike it way up. We are just asking for a reasonable, modest adjustment of the minimum wage. We ought to do that. Gas tax, bring that to the debate. I do not intend to vote to reduce the gas tax. I would like to. I would like to see people pay less taxes in a range of areas, but I do not intend to vote to increase the Federal deficit. I have been one, along with others, who care and continue to ratchet that Federal deficit downward. I do not intend in any event to transfer money from the Federal Treasury, so the deficit increases, to the pockets of the oil industry, and leave drivers and taxpayers stranded high and dry. The TEAM Act that has been introduced in the last day or so, bring that to the floor, entertain amendments, have a vote on that. That is the way the Senate ought to do its business. It is probably not the most politically adept way. It does not most easily advance an agenda of someone, but a way for the Senate to advance these issues, have a vote, and determine what the will of the Senate is. I yield the floor.|104505|960509|1|Scr09my96-139 1.txt|16|000203|S4887-S4888|9484|1785|ND|Byron Dorgan|S|NA|D

10419960059076|Mr. President, I thank my friend from Wyoming for initiating the discussion--this has been talked about a great deal today--and for now withdrawing the amendment. That does not mean we are not going to be revisiting things like this in the future, but in the interests of moving the budget process along it is best to delay the discussion. We have today and we have tomorrow night, which is the time the majority has indicated they would like to complete work on the budget. We are already way late on the budget. It was supposed to be acted upon earlier. So I hope we could move ahead in a brisker fashion than we have before. I would simply say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, we are awaiting more amendments. If there were either a Democrat or Republican Senator seeking to offer an amendment right now, this Senator would yield. But I send out the call once again, we are going to have a crammed, packed day today without any votes. The votes will be stacked for tomorrow. But Tuesday is going to be one of those most, most difficult times. It appears to me, unless we can move in much quicker fashion than we have thus far, we are going to find ourselves tomorrow night into one of those situations where the Senate looks awfully bad. That is when we run out of the allotted time that has been yielded on the budget amendment, that is 25 hours on each side, and then we get ourselves into a situation where Members of the Senate insist upon offering additional amendments--and they have that right--but even though we just put up the amendment, there is no debate whatsoever. And then we immediately go to a rollcall vote. It always seems to me if historians would ever look at the U.S. Senate and address some of our worst, our unproductive moments, it would be that time that typically happens with the budget resolution, that is voting without debate, voting oftentimes without a majority of the Senate even having the slightest idea of what the amendment is designed to do. So this is the time to offer amendments. I hope on this Monday morning, before reckoning day Tuesday, we would get these amendments introduced. At the present time we already have 20 votes scheduled for tomorrow. Even if those were 10-minute votes, which all of them cannot be, we can see the difficult timeframe we are in. Also tomorrow, Tuesday, is going to be shortened by what I was advised recently, by the fact we will, most of us, will be going to a memorial ceremony at I believe 11 o'clock tomorrow morning at the National Cathedral as a result of the death of the late, great Admiral Boorda. So, that is going to take time out of our day tomorrow. I simply appeal to Senators on both sides of the aisle to come down now, offer your amendments, curtail as much debate time as we can so we can move ahead. There was an amendment introduced this morning by the Senator from Missouri that I would like to make some comments on in opposition. The pending business I make reference to is the amendment offered by Senator Ashcroft, amendment No. 4008. It sounds to me like deja vu all over again. While viewers of the Senate may have received the impression--let me repeat that--viewers of the Senate may have received the impression that we are trying to reduce the deficit here, it seems that the Senator from Missouri has another thing in mind altogether. He wants to revisit the voodoo economics of the early 1980's that got us into the fiscal mess that the United States finds itself in today. His amendment would cut taxes first, before we have done the hard work of cutting the deficit. This Senator is for cutting the deficit above everything else. This Senator, and many similarly situated, would like very much to reduce taxes. That is the ultimate goal of a politician these days. It is not a bad goal. But the thing we have to remember is that we cannot do everything at the same time if everyone is going in different directions. And I am afraid that is what is demonstrated above everything else, unfortunately, by the amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri. He has very specific ideas about where to cut taxes and I suppose that everyone favors tax cuts. But he is far less specific about how to come up with the money to pay for it. In what I heard of the Senator's speech, he did not say one word about where the money is coming from. So the arithmetic is simple. Cut taxes by $276 billion over the next 6 years--that is wonderful. That is what everybody is for. Who can be against that--unless you are sincere about cutting the deficit of the United States of America. I thought that was the No. 1 item of concern for Members on both sides of the aisle. Cutting taxes by $276 billion over the next 6 years, as suggested by the Senator from Missouri, sounds real good and it is a whopping tax cut. But the problem is, they look around to find the discretionary savings to pay for this at some later date. That is the kind of murky fiscal thinking that has got us into the situation we are trying to address today and have been trying to address for some months. Mr. President, I need to correct a few things that the Senator from Missouri said in his diatribe against government. That is another very popular thing to do. Cutting government and carrying on diatribes against how bad government is is really good politics, but is it good sense? The Senator from Missouri said many, many things against government. The Senator would have us believe that the 1993 budget bill is the cause of the tax burden on the middle-class citizens of America. Nothing--nothing, Mr. President--could be further from the truth, in reality. In reality, 98 percent of income taxpayers do not pay 1 more penny in taxes because of the 1993 tax bill. I wish we had the time to go back to listen to the attacks from that side of the aisle on the 1993 tax bill. It would be astonishing for people to read about the reasons that the people on that side of the aisle voted against the 1993 tax bill. The 1993 tax bill is the main reason for the fact that we have had 3 successive years of reductions in deficit of the Federal Government of the United States of America--something that has not happened since Hector was a pup. The fact of the matter is that, primarily as a result of that bill, we have reduced the annual deficit from the range of $300 billion down to an estimated $140 billion to $147 billion this year. The deficit has been cut by more than half. Millions of working families had their taxes cut because of the changes in the earned-income tax credit in the 1993 bill. Mr. President, there are seldom things that we do around here that are perfect. But it seems to me that at a time when we are trying desperately to put things together on both sides of the aisle to balance the budget by the year 2002 and return sanity to the financing of the Federal Government, the amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri is the worst possible step that we could take. Senator Ashcroft's amendment is a budget buster, by any definition. Senator Ashcroft has stated that the cost of the proposal would be $276 billion over the next 6 years, over $45 billion annually. Democrats recognize that Social Security taxes present a burden to lower income taxpayers and have, as a result, strongly supported the earned income tax credit. The earned income tax credit was designed, in part, to offset these costs. Just so that we understand, the earned income tax credit is something that gives the very lowest income people of the United States of America a credit to try to get them up above the poverty line, get them out of welfare so that we will not have that welfare drain that is continuing to cause us problems. The Republican budget cuts eliminates that earned income tax credit for the poorest among us by $17 billion over the next 6 years. Last year's Republican budget would have actually increased taxes. It would have increased taxes on those lowest paid people in the United States, which amounts to about 7 million working families. This year's budget must include many of the same proposals. President Clinton, in his 1993 budget, lowered taxes on working families by increasing the earned income tax credit. That is designed to get people off welfare, get them to work, and have them contribute to society, as we would all like to have them do if they had an income above the poverty level. But I repeat, President Clinton's 1993 budget lowered taxes on these working families by increasing the earned income tax credit. In 1996, over 15 million families will receive a tax break as a result of that bill. In my State of Nebraska alone, over 78,000 families will receive a tax cut averaging about $650 for the year. I want to emphasize once again that those are the lowest paid people in the United States that we are trying to send a lifeline to lift them up by their bootstraps, if you will, Mr. President, to give them a chance to be what most of them would like to be--successful taxpaying citizens. So when we are talking about cutting Social Security taxes, I simply say that I would like to do that, too. I also say that the Democratic Party, under the leadership of President Clinton, has done just that in another form--the earned income tax credit. I am sure that amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri is good politics. But it is not good government. I yield the remainder of our time, and I yield the floor.|104490|960520|35|Scr20my96-46 1.txt|808|000959|S5305-S5376|9446|1706|NE|Jim Exon|S|NA|D

10419960062479|Mr. President, thank you so much As I was saying about the Senator from Nebraska, he has stood for real balance in the budget, both in terms of dollars in and dollars out, so that we do not add to a debt, but also a balance of needs. What is very interesting to me, in particular, Senator Exon, as the former chairman of the Budget Committee, and now as its ranking member, has always been one who has stood for the strongest possible defense that America must have. When I hear him stand up and talk about some of the excesses in that area, it means a lot to me. What is interesting to me, when we had an opportunity to vote on budgets, we had three budgets. We had the Republican budget before the Senate today, coming back from the conference; we had the Democratic budget, which, basically, was President Clinton's budget; and we had the bipartisan budget, which was put together by Republicans and Democrats in this U.S. Senate. I had the privilege of voting for two budgets, the Democrat budget and the bipartisan budget. I did not vote for the Republican budget. Although many people's eyes glaze over when you talk about the budget, it is really a very simple document when you think about it. It is a statement of our priorities, and a statement, really, of what we think we ought to be doing as a nation, just as we and our families will determine every year what our priorities are, where we will spend our dollars. We do that here. One would think that the cold war had not ended if you look at this budget. That is what is so terribly confusing to me, because we know we have to be lean in this budget. We know we are not doing as much for education as we would like. We are not doing as much to clean up the environment as we would like, at least most of us. We are certainly not doing enough health research as we would like. Every dollar that we can find to make these investments is a dollar, I think, that is well spent when we make them. Yet, we have this Republican Senate and House throwing $12 billion more at the Pentagon than they asked for in budget authority. That, to me, is nonsensical. We need the strongest military in the world, and we have it, and we will always have it. We do not need to throw dollars that the generals and the admirals do not want. What is the point of it? It is wasting money, money that we need elsewhere, money that could even reduce the deficit further. To me, it is not a close call as far as how I will vote. The Republican budget left the Senate, and I think the priorities were out of whack. Too many cuts in Medicare, too many cuts in Medicaid, too many cuts in education, too many cuts in the environment, and too much spending on the Pentagon--more than they asked for. It is something I hope that the American people will look at, because it is not pie-in- the-sky and it is not rhetoric. It is not politics. It is budgeting. It is hard dollars that will go to pay for what the American people need to have. Mr. President, we do have an election coming up in November. Frankly, I think a lot of these issues will be issues in that election. I can think of no greater honor than to serve on the Budget Committee. When I was in the House, I spent 6 years there, and here in the U.S. Senate I am finishing the fourth. To me, it is one of the most important things that I do, because the hopes and dreams of American people, their aspirations, are really contained in that budget. All you have to do is look at education, and see how the Republicans are slashing it, to understand that will translate into fewer scholarships for our young people to go to college, fewer slots that can be filled in Head Start so our kids can get off to a good start on a level playing field, fewer ways to clean up Superfund sites. Frankly, in California, we have many that are languishing and are dangerous, with toxins seeping into water supplies, because we do not have enough resources there. This is the greatest Nation in the world. We can do better. The Democratic budget, the Clinton budget, the bipartisan budget, I think all of those are quite mainstream in their approach, compared to this budget that is before the Senate today. We do not have to hurt our seniors the way they will be hurt with this. We do not have to hurt our children the way they will be hurt with this. Now we have a whole new idea. We will go back to star wars. We will build a full star wars. I think we ought to prepare, in case we have to. We should do all the research. I have always taken that position. But to get ready to deploy a star wars system--we will be facing that in the defense bill--it will cost us billions of dollars, billions of dollars, when we do not even know exactly what we need to do, and we are being told the threat is not defined yet. It just does not make sense. I submit, Mr. President, if you went to a supermarket or shopping center in Tennessee, or I went to one in California, or my friend went to one in Nebraska, and you said to the person who was coming in to do his shopping: Out of these few things, which do you feel most threatened by, crime in the street and that you might get mugged or attacked, or somebody in your family getting breast cancer or prostate cancer, or a ballistic missile coming over and hitting you in your house? I honestly think that people would say we should have the strongest military in the world, but the threats that are facing me are absolutely that someone in my family would get such a dreadful disease or that, yes, someone could be a victim of a crime. Yet, you look at this budget and it has the opposite kind of priorities. So I thank my friend from Nebraska for his leadership, his very down- to-earth Nebraska leadership. I will sorely miss it next year. I think he stands for mainstream America in his opposition to this budget. I urge my colleagues to vote against this budget. It got worse when it went into conference. It has more of the Newt Gingrich approach to budgeting, and I frankly think we ought to vote ``no.'' I yield the floor at this time.|104445|960612|5|Scr12jn96-158 1.txt|28|000123|S6136-S6137|6062|1149|CA|Barbara Boxer|S|NA|D

10419960071720|I rise in opposition to this amendment. It has been almost universally opposed, first of all. The issue the Senator from Iowa wishes to strike appears in President Clinton's most recent welfare reform proposal. Likewise, the reform which we try to bring about in this bill was in the minority leader's reconciliation bill. The reason is that four out of every five low-income children attend school with a breakfast program. The program has expanded very rapidly. It is not clear that expansion funds would have a marginal effect. The amendment that we are considering reduces savings by $112 million. This means, if Senator Harkin's amendment is adopted, we will have to find the savings probably in some other nutrition programs. I find that unacceptable.

10419960078763|Mr. President, during the August recess, 14 youngsters from Cranston, RI, achieved something that no Rhode Islanders had ever achieved before. On August 22, the Cranston Western Little League All-Stars were crowned the National Champions at this year's Little League World Series in Williamsport, PA. Mr. President, I know we are dealing with important matters here. But this is an important matter also. This wonderful team of youngsters from our State first had to win the State championship. Then they went to the national championships in Williamsport where they defeated--can you believe it--California 5 to 1. Three days later in front of 17,000 fans and a national television audience they defeated the team that had previously defeated them, namely the heavily favored Panama City, FL, team which put them into the world championship game. That was against Chinese Taipei. I think for anyone who follows the Little League baseball knows that the Chinese Taipei team was always an outstanding one and, indeed, they did win against the Cranston Western All-Stars. This was truly an amazing accomplishment. When Cranston Western started down this road, it was just one of several thousand teams across the country vying for the right to play for the world championship. To get into the World Series, it had to win three mini- tournaments against the best teams in Rhode Island, and then in the Northeast, over the course of 2 months. Listen to some of these last-minute heroics. It took a home run in the tenth inning just to advance beyond the district playoffs. Then they had to win three straight games, including two in a row over a previously undefeated South Kingstown team, to stave off elimination in the State tournament. And in the final game of the East Regionals, Cranston Western needed a game-saving, diving catch by their left fielder, and then a three-run homer in the bottom of the seventh, to overcome a tough Pennsylvania squad. Once they got to Williamsport, the job only got tougher. History certainly was not on their side. Indeed, Cranston Western was only the third team from Rhode Island to make it to the Little League World Series, and the first to do so since 1980. And in neither of those two cases did a Rhode Island team win a single game at the national level. What's more, in the first game, they had to face California--a State that had produced 5 World Series champions and had been represented in the tournament a record 32 times. But these courageous, young Rhode Islanders proved their mettle. They shook off any butterflies they might have had, and defeated the Californians by a 5 to 1 score. Three days later, in front of 17,000 fans and a national television audience, they avenged an earlier loss to heavily favored Panama City, FL. That win put them in the world championship game. Unfortunately, Cranston Western came up short in the World Series final against Chinese Taipei. But that loss in no way diminished what these boys from the city of Cranston accomplished. They were front page news in Rhode Island for a solid week. Nearly every television in the State--whether in private homes or restaurants--was tuned to the final game. And when they returned home they received a hero's welcome, complete with a police escort from the Connecticut border and a fireworks display in their hometown. What did these boys learn from their experience this summer? I can think of three things. First, they learned that you don't have to be the biggest, or the strongest, or even the most-talented to succeed in life. While those attributes are important, they're meaningless without heart, grit, and fierce determination. And Cranston Western led the pack in those three categories. Second, they learned that practice really does make perfect. Throughout the summer, the team spent nearly every waking moment on the baseball diamond, whether it was at official practices or playing pick- up games. Moreover, at the beginning of their championship run, every player made a commitment to the team not to miss a single practice. And each one of them lived up to that commitment. Third, and I believe most importantly, they learned to place a high value on teamwork. No single player could be counted on to carry the load alone. Each member of that team made a crucial contribution at one point or another. That's a critical lesson I hope these little leaguers will remember for the rest of their lives. And Mr. President, as I'm sure they would tell you, these boys had a lot of help along the way. There was their very capable manager, Mike Varrato. He was the one who set the lineup, arranged the defense, and made sure the team was physically and mentally ready to play every day. They had veteran coaches Nick Dinezza and Larry Lepore. These two men helped the pitchers with their location, threw batting practice, and hit hundreds, if not thousands, of ground balls to the infielders and fly balls to the outfielders. There's no doubt that on many occasions, the coaches went home more tired than the young ballplayers. And, of course, there were the parents. You've never seen a more loyal group. They scheduled family meals around games and practices. They gave up summer vacations at the beach to follow their sons from one venue to the next. During the games, they rang cowbells, and banged pots and pans, and did whatever it took to rally the troops. They cheered mightily when their boys won, and hugged them and reassured them the few times that they lost. And I'm sure they never hesitated to voice their opinions whenever the umpires made a bad call. And so, I want to offer my heartiest congratulations to the members of the Cranston Western Little League team, and all who were associated with their championship season. They stirred an enormous amount of pride in Rhode Island, and made for a very exciting August in our State. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the team roster be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:|104516|960905|1|Scr05se96-176 1.txt|16|000112|S9962-S9963|6072|1035|RI|John Chafee|S|NA|R

This bill would provide required Congressional authorization for the Coast Guard to expand its current use of Coast Guard divers to form a broader search and rescue mission application. I want to acknowledge my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts, Congressman Gerry Studds, who is the author of the Coast Guard Rescue Swimmer Training Program which this legislation amends and with whom I have worked in developing this legislation which he will introduce in the House. The Coast Guard has used its divers, trained at the Naval Diving School in Panama City, FL, only for salvage operations associated with Coast Guard aids to navigation and ice-breaking missions. This bill would authorize the Coast Guard to develop and implement a program to extend the use of these highly trained divers to search and rescue efforts. Under current search and rescue procedures, the Coast Guard will dispatch a helicopter when a ship is reported to be in distress or a marine accident is reported. When it is anticipated that a diver may be needed to assist in a rescue, the Coast Guard uses contract personnel who usually are volunteer policemen, firemen, or local State marine policemen who have had specialized diver training. A call will be made to secure the services of a diver, and the helicopter will wait to depart until the diver reaches its station, or it will fly to another location to pick up the diver--all before it flies to the rescue scene. This often results in the helicopter being delayed--even if only a few minutes--in reaching the rescue scene. Sometimes no diver is available within a reasonable period of time, in which case the helicopter proceeds to the scene with no diver on board. The program that this legislation will establish is designed both to speed this process in the realization that, in rescue situations, minutes and even seconds can mean life or death--especially in the waters off our northern coasts, and to provide a pool of divers within the Coast Guard. Where a qualified diver is available at a Coast Guard station, a rescue helicopter can load that diver and immediately depart for the rescue situation without any delay. A recent episode in the North Atlantic off Massachusetts amply illustrates how the program this legislation would establish could make a vital contribution. In the early hours of September 5, the fishing vessel Heather Lynne II carrying a crew of three capsized. The rescue helicopter was unable to bring a diver with it because none was available when the emergency call was received. After reaching the site of the capsized vessel, and determining that a diver was needed, the helicopter had to return to the mainland to pick up a diver. A considerable amount of time was lost in this process. The Coast Guard is charged with maintaining constant vigilance--to protect lives and property on our waterways and to enforce our maritime, immigration, antidrug, and other laws. In my judgment, it has performed capably and honorably throughout its history, and Americans should take both considerable pride and comfort in that knowledge. It is the Congress' responsibility to provide the Coast Guard with the resources it needs to perform its missions. This legislation will enhance the service's resources for its search and rescue mission, and increase its ability to save lives and property. All who use our waterways and oceans will be safer as a result. Mr. President, this legislation should be approved by the Congress as soon as possible--I hope it will be this year. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the legislation be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:|104479|960917|1|Scr17se96-180 1.txt|636|000708|S10684-S10689|3789|630|MA|John Kerry|S|NA|D
10419960083829|Mr. President, I rise to take just a few moments to talk a bit about the gag clause that involves the right of patients across this country to know all the information about their medical condition and the treatments that are appropriate and ought to be made available. I wish to discuss it in the context of the pipeline safety bill. In the beginning. I particularly wish to thank the bipartisan leadership of Senator Daschle and Senator Lott who have worked closely with us on this also, the continued bipartisan effort of Senators Kennedy and Kyl who, in particular, have worked very hard to try to address this legislation in a responsible way and to demonstrate the bipartisan spirit of this effort. It really all began with Dr. Ganske of Iowa and Congressman Ed Markey on the House side, where both pursued this effort in a bipartisan way. Senators Lott and Daschle, Kyl, Kennedy, and I and others have spent several days working to reach an agreement with respect to the legislation that I originally sought to offer several weeks ago with respect to the patient's right to know. These negotiations have been lengthy, they certainly have been difficult, and they are not yet concluded. Because there has been much good faith on the part of a number of Members on both sides of the aisle, on both the Democratic and Republican side of the aisle, I think it is fair to say that we have made a considerable amount of progress, and I want to make it very clear to the Senate I intend to keep up this fight throughout the session because it is so fundamentally important that the patients of this country in the fastest growing sector of American health care, the health management organization sector, have all the information they need in order to make choices about their health care. I do think it is important to say tonight that I do not think it is appropriate to withhold any longer a vote on the pipeline safety bill as these negotiations go forward. The pipeline safety bill, in my view, is a good bill. It is an important bill. It, too, has bipartisan support as a result of a great deal of effort, and I would like to put in a special word for the efforts of Senator Exon, of Nebraska, who has labored for a long time on this measure. He is, of course, retiring from the Senate. His leaving will be much felt, and it seems appropriate that this important and good bill to protect the safety of our energy pipelines go forward. And so I want to make it clear to the Senate tonight I do not think the Senate should withhold a vote on the pipeline safety bill any further as the negotiations go forward with respect to the gag clause in health maintenance organizations that is so often found in plans around this country. If I might, I wish to take a few minutes to explain why this issue is so important in American health care. Most people say to themselves, what is a gag clause? What does this have to do with me? Why is it so important that it has generated all this attention in the Senate? A gag clause is something that really keeps the patients in our country from full and complete information about the medical condition and the treatments that are available to them. I think it is fair to say--I know the Senator from Utah, Mr. Bennett, has done a lot of work in the health care field--reasonable people have differences of opinion with respect to the health care issue. People can differ about the role of the Federal Government; they can differ about the role of the private sector, but it seems to me absolutely indisputable that patients ought to have access to all the information--not half of it, not three-quarters, but all the information--with respect to their medical condition. What is happening around the country is some managed care plans--this is not all of them. There is good managed care in this country. My part of the Nation pioneered managed care. Too often managed care plans, the scofflaws in the managed care field are cutting corners, and so what they do either in writing or through a pattern of oral communication, these managed care plans tell their doctors, ``Don't fill those patients in on all the information about their medical condition.'' Or they say, ``There are some treatments that may be expensive and we think you shouldn't be telling everybody about them.'' Or maybe they say, ``We're watching the referrals that you're making and if you make a lot of referrals outside the health maintenance organization to other physicians, other providers, we're going to watch that. If you make too many of them, we're going to consider getting some other people to deliver our health services.'' So these are gag clauses in the literal sense. They get in the way of the doctor-patient relationship and either in writing in the contract established by the health maintenance organization or orally through a pattern of communications between the health maintenance plan and the physician, the doctor is told in very blunt, straightforward terms, ``Look, you're not supposed to tell those patients all the facts about their medical condition or all the treatments that might be available to them.'' I think these restrictions on access to patient information care turn American health care on its head. The Hippocratic oath, for example, to physicians starts with, ``First do no harm.'' If you have these gag clauses, essentially, instead of ``First do no harm,'' in these health maintenance organizations the charge is, first, think about the bottom line. Think about the financial condition of the plan and that maybe the plan will have a little less revenue if physicians really tell their patients what is going on and tell them about referrals and the like. Trust, in my view, is the basis of the doctor-patient relationship. Without that trust, physicians cannot perform adequately as caregivers. The patients get shortchanged, in terms of the quality of their health care. And I think that, when you limit straightforward and complete information between physicians and their patients, what you are doing is prescribing bad medicine. Mr. President, there are a number of provisions that are central to this debate and there are two or three that have consumed most of our attention over the last few days, in terms of trying to work this legislation out on a bipartisan basis. Let me say, especially Senator Kyl has done yeoman work, in terms of trying to bring all sides together. He has led the effort on the Republican side. He has worked particularly hard with me on a couple of the provisions that I would like to take just a minute or two of the Senate's time to discuss this evening. The first is with respect to enforcement provisions in this bill. Senator Kyl and I both share the view that the States should take the leadership role with respect to enforcement of these gag clause provisions. There is precedent for this in the medigap legislation, the legislation to protect older people from ripoffs in the supplemental policies sold in addition to their Medicare. We have looked at other approaches. In particular, the enforcement provisions that the Senate came together on in a bipartisan way in the maternity legislation looked attractive, but Senator Kyl and I have spent a special effort, trying to work out the provisions with respect to ensuring that the States are given the lead in terms of enforcing the anti-gag clause legislation. I think we have made considerable progress. All Senator ought to know there is bipartisan interest in not having some Federal micromanagement, run-from-Washington kind of operation with respect to the enforcement provisions in this gag clause legislation. The second area that has consumed considerable amount of time in our discussions involves matters of religious and moral expression. Here, the issue, as it does so often in the U.S. Senate, involves especially abortion. Senator Kyl and I have worked hard to try to ensure that an individual physician who has religious or moral views with respect to abortion would not be required to express those views in a way that was contrary to deeply held religious or moral principles that that physician had. At the same time, I think it is understood that, if this is not carefully done, such provisions could become a new form of institutional gag, which would limit communication between doctors and patients. Senator Kyl and I have, I think, been able to bring about an approach that does allow an individual physician who, for religious or moral reasons, desires not to discuss abortion issues to be able to do that. I think we will be able to resolve that in a way that is good health policy, is fair, and bipartisan. Now, the continuing resolution, of course, is before us. The Senate will be dealing with this in the hours ahead. Some may consider it will be the days ahead--but certainly the hours ahead. I want the Senate to understand that I think, with respect to the future of American health care, making sure that patients have access to all information about their medical condition and the treatments that are available to them is about as important as it gets. The Senator from Vermont also has done a great deal of work in the health care area over the years. We have had a chance to work together on ERISA legislation, and a variety of other matters. I come back to the proposition that there are a lot of areas where people can differ in the health field. Health is a complex riddle by anybody's calculus. And these debates about the role of the Federal Government and the role of the private sector--these are areas where reasonable people do have differences of opinion. What I think is indisputable, however, is the importance of patients getting all the facts and the patients being in a position to know all of the matters that relate to their getting the best treatment for them, given the kind of medical problems that they face. So, this ultimately, this question of how to deal with this issue, is not an issue about abortion. No abortions are being performed or referrals made. It is not a question of Federal micromanagement, because the States are put clearly in the lead position with respect to enforcement. It is not a regulatory paradigm, in the sense that Members may have different views with respect to the type of approach. Whether it is a medical savings account approach that some have favored, or single-payer approach that some have favored, this bill does not touch any of those issues. This bill gets to one question and that is: As we look to the decisions involving 21st century health care, are we going to put patients in the driver's seat with respect to their own health care so they can get information? It seems almost absurd to me that, at a time when we look at how medical information may be exchanged in the future using the Internet, so that folks in rural Vermont and rural Oregon can tap all these exciting new technologies so as to get more information about their health care and about the treatments available to them, it seems almost fundamental to say that, when a patient and a doctor or a nurse or chiropractor at a health plan sits down with a patient and that patient's family, that provider, that doctor or nurse or chiropractor, is in a position to say to the family, ``Look, here are all the facts that you and your loved ones face with respect to your medical condition. You may want to pursue this particular treatment. Perhaps I should refer you to Dr. A or Dr. B, who is outside the health plan.'' But whatever the ultimate choice of the consumer is at that point, at least the consumer can make it in an informed way. Right now, while there is good managed care in our country, and I have seen it in my part of the United States, in the Pacific Northwest, too often there have been managed care plans that do not meet those high standards. There are plans that have told their physicians, their nurses, their chiropractors and others: We are going to be watching you, with respect to making referrals. We want you to know, we are looking over your shoulder with respect to expensive treatments, and those kinds of gag provisions are getting in the way of the doctor-patient relationship, and the trust that is so important. So I want it understood, Mr. President, that I am going to use every ounce of my strength, working with Senator Kyl and Senators on both sides of the aisle, to make sure that this legislation is part of the continuing resolution. I want to, again, let the Senate know that we are very appreciative of Senators Daschle and Lott and the bipartisan leadership that has worked cooperatively with us. We want to make sure that this legislation gets into the continuing resolution. Managed care is the fastest growing part of American health care. Both Democrats and Republicans throughout this Congress have looked to managed care repeatedly as the discussions have gone forward on Medicare and other issues. So it is important that patients in these plans get all the facts, get all the information, and we are going to go forward in good faith, as we have done over the last week. Senator Kyl and I have put a big chunk of our waking hours into this effort to try to do it in a bipartisan way. I believe we can get it done. And in the spirit of the progress that has been made and to facilitate the passage of other important legislation, I would like to make it clear that I believe that the Senate should no longer withhold a vote on the pipeline safety bill.

We are not going to do anything that our constituents expect us to do. What we are going to do is, we are just going to willy-nilly accept any policy that this administration has in effect, or anything that they have proposed to put into effect, and we are going to accept that. That is not what our constituents expect us to do. That is not what they sent us back here to do. Whether we agree or disagree with the underlying bill, our constituents did not send us back here to vote blindly for any policy that this administration has in effect or anything that they proposed. When we talk about the roadless, they have not even finished the hearing process. They have not even finished the comment period process, and we are going to accept it.

I have only been here for a short period of time compared to most of my colleagues, but I can tell them there is no way that their constituents expect them to come back here, and I have never seen anything like this put on the floor of the House, where we will just blindly accept whatever policies the administration has in effect or anything that they have proposed|105307|970423|14|Hcr23ap97-92 1.txt|350|355|H1758-H1773|373|63|NJ|Frank Pallone|H|6|Democratic

10519970009243|Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time. I appreciate the leadership of the gentleman on this important issue. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1252, the Judicial Reform Act, and want to speak about two provisions of the bill. The first one is one long-championed by our former colleague, Sonny Bono, which ensures that the will of millions of voters is not overturned by a single Federal judge. Of course, the illustration was given in the State of California, but that can be duplicated in Arkansas, in which the initiative petition drive alternative of the voters is utilized quite frequently. Whenever we have a ballot initiative that is passed by the voters, I think it is wrong to have that potentially overturned by one single Federal judge. I believe the three-judge panel is a better procedure because it preserves the right of judicial review, which I believe in. Yet at the same time it ensures it is not going to be passed on the whim of one Federal judge, but would at least require three to review and act upon what the voters of a particular State have done, and it would be a due regard for the Constitution of the United States. The second thing that I believe is important in this provision is the section that prohibits Federal judges from levying taxes on localities or municipalities as part of a settlement or a court ruling. Mr. Chairman, I believe that our constituents are probably wondering why we are even debating this, because the Constitution gives Congress the sole authority to impose taxes on the citizens. Because of what has happened in one particular case in Missouri, there is the fear that it could happen again. So this kind of judicial activism is, indeed, considered an outrage by the American public, and this legislation will ensure it does not happen again in our localities. So I believe that this is appropriate. It is responsible legislation; it has a good balance between the judicial review that is appropriate for judges to maintain, but yet we in this Congress are sworn to uphold the Constitution of the United States as well. I believe that this legislation is in line with our constitutional authority, and I would ask my colleagues to support it.|105348|970507|144|Hcr07my97-102 1.txt|2547|2620|H2281-H2313|4455|715|NY|Sherwood Boehlert|H|23|Republican

10519970020621|Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4105, the Internet Tax Freedom Act. I am proud to have been an original co-sponsor of the pre-cursor to this legislation and believe that it is crucial to the continued development of the Internet. In the last 5 years, the growth of the Internet has created an entirely new method of communicating: electronic commerce. With this rapid growth we have seen tremendous benefits and revolutionary technology, presenting unprecedented social and economic issues. These changes are forcing national and State legislators to quickly catch up with this growth from a policy-making perspective. The taxation of everyday sales transactions presents many complex economic and constitutional issues that should be resolved in a deliberate and holistic process, rather than a patchwork of rules and court decisions that would likely accompany future efforts by State and local governments to tax Internet transactions and services. The Internet Tax Freedom Act will give Congress and the technology industry the opportunity to examine Internet taxation issues thoroughly during a 3-year moratorium on State and local Internet taxation. It reflects the truly admirable spirit of cooperation between its chief sponsor, Representative Chris Cox, and State and local policymakers who were able to come together and work hard on a matter which has multi- faceted consequences on retail businesses, State and local treasuries, continued technological development, and our judicial system, to name a few. The Internet is a revolutionary technology that has become an integral part of our nation's economic growth. And it promises to expand beyond anything we could imagine. It would be detrimental, I believe, to our nation's leadership in this industry if we were to allow taxation issues to stunt the growth of the Internet. For this reason, I am very pleased that we have been able to bring the Internet Tax Freedom Act to the floor today. And I particularly want to commend Mr. Cox for his foresight in introducing this legislation that we will be voting on today.|105084|970710|471|Hcr10jy97-82 1.txt|8510|8541|H5049-H5128|2031|354|CO|Diana DeGette|H|1|Democratic
10519970024370|Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Mr. Chairman, we recently had an election in Louisiana under the ``motor voter'' law. That election left us with a huge and extended voter inquiry by the Senate committee questioning the outcome of that Senate race. The reason that happened in our State was, the allegations of people registering improperly and then voting multiple times by simply changing outer garments and coats and walking back in the polls and voting again, the reason all of that happened was because the election safeguards in our State completely broke down. The Senate committee that investigated that election ended up saying, ``We cannot tell you whether or not voter fraud occurred in Louisiana, because all of the systems by which we ought to be able to tell whether it occurred broke down.'' A newspaper in Lake Charles using the motor voter law attempted to register 21 fictitious individuals and ended up registering 19 successfully. One of them was a dog, and anyone representing themselves to be that person that was a dog could have shown up on Election Day in Louisiana and voted because this was no requirement in the law then to produce any photo I.D. Since that time, the Federal Government has finally allowed Louisiana to require a photo I.D. It is now the law of Louisiana, now approved by the Justice Department in our State following that terrible, indeed questionable election in Louisiana. What this amendment does is to do two things that I think are vitally important to improve the motor voter law in our country. It says that the States can indeed provide mail balloting if they want to, mail registration, but that if they do, proof of citizenship should be required. We ought to know who is registering. We should be able to prove who we are; and then, secondly, when one shows up to vote, there ought to be some identifiable photo, just as one would present a photo when one checks one's luggage at an airport or try to buy tobacco in a grocery store, some identifiable indication of who you are, that you are the person who is registering. Those two changes are critical for valid elections in America.|105422|970724|106|Hcr24jy97-78 1.txt|2245|2246|H5750-H5775|93|15|PA|Joe McDade|H|10|Republican

It is outrageous that the pro-abortion advocates want to force the American taxpayers to pay for the abortions of Federal prisoners. Instead of sending the message to Federal prisoners that the answer to their problem is to kill their unborn babies, let us urge them to take responsibility and consider what is best for the child they are carrying. Let us not compound the problem with an act of violence on top of an act of violence. When this issue was debated in 1995, one of the supporters of this pro-abortion amendment asked the Members of the House, ``Who will speak for these children?'' Then she went on to declare, ``We must speak for these children.'' If this is true, we must speak for the children, then I guess those who support this amendment believe that the unborn children of Federal prisoners want to be killed by their mothers. We should not vote for the death of unborn children at the expense of all American taxpayers. I urge a ``no'' vote on the DeGette amendment.|105431|970916|82|Hcr16se97-103 1.txt|2249|2251|H7324-H7350|150|24|PA|William Goodling|H|19|Republican
10519970031548|Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's interest in this issue. As he knows, illegal gambling on the Internet is a rapidly growing industry. The Justice Department estimates that $600 million was bet illegally on sports alone over the Internet last year, a tenfold increase over the previous year. I applaud my friend from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, in the Senate for moving legislation in the other body. I want to assure my friend from Florida that we are currently working in the Committee on the Judiciary to move corresponding legislation before the August recess. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I appreciate the Gentleman's interest in this issue. Illegal gambling on the internet is a rapidly growing industry--the Justice Department estimates that $600 million was bet illegally on sports alone over the internet last year, a tenfold increase over 1996. Congress must take action this year to curb illegal internet gambling, and I have introduced legislation that would clamp down on this type of activity. I applaud my friend from Arizona for moving legislation in the other body to address this issue, and I want to assure my friend from Florida that we are currently working in the Judiciary Committee to move corresponding legislation before the August recess. As my friend is aware, however, a number of areas and concerns surrounding this issue are still outstanding, and I want to assure the Gentleman that we are currently working with all parties to resolve those issues as we continue to move the process forward. I would therefore at this time ask that the Gentleman withdraw his amendment, so that we might continue working through the Committee process to produce a strong piece of legislation to combat internet gambling.|105510|970918|173|Hcr18se97-98 1.txt|5990|5992|H7544-H7573|95|17|VA|James Moran|H|8|Democratic

As has been said by most of my colleagues, this is a very solemn time and a very difficult time for Democrats and Republicans alike. Obviously, for the American people as well. It is very important that we be fair, and I am troubled by some of the statements that I have heard that are challenging this issue of fairness. Mr. Speaker, let me say that in 1978 a Democratic Congress passed the independent counsel statute. That made major changes since the Watergate hearings of 1974. Three times since 1978 that independent counsel statute has been passed. Most recently it was reauthorized by a Democratic Congress, and it was done when President Clinton was in office. I think it is important to note that we are complying with the rule of law under the independent counsel statute. It says, ``An independent counsel shall advise the House of Representatives of any substantial and credible information which such independent counsel receives that may constitute grounds for an impeachment.'' That is exactly what is happening here. We are complying with the rule of law. We very much want to deal with this in the most bipartisan way possible.|105176|970926|65|Hcr26se97-43 1.txt|798|799|H8003-H8022|77|13|IN|Dan Burton|H|6|Republican

10519970035532|Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the actions that the administration has taken in their budget proposal this year with the farm crisis going on. I spoke yesterday about the $573 million tax increase that they propose to put on our livestock farmers who are dying out there today. Also, I would like to point out what they are doing to help the grain farmer and the person trying to do conservation work. In their budget proposal, they want to tax people for the information to find out how to comply with the programs. So when you go into the NRCS office or you go to the FSA office, bring your checkbook because the administration says they are going to charge you to get information from you. It is outrageous. I would just like to tell the Secretary of Agriculture and this administration, they have taken enough out of the hide of the American farmer, and they better go to work and try to help them rather than to continue to tax them and put them out of business.|105089|971007|44|Hcr07oc97-115 1.txt|614|646|H8512-H8537|2026|324|CO|Daniel Schaefer|H|6|Republican

10519970037456|Mr. Speaker, Will Rogers once said that you have to be an optimist to be a Democrat and you have got to be a humorist to stay one. Yesterday the President must have thought that he was using humor when he said that the creation of the surplus is due to the fiscal restraint and leadership of his administration. I believe the only thing that the President left out of his speech was a line from the Wizard of Oz, Toto, ``I do not think we are in Kansas anymore,'' because this make-believe yellow brick road theory that his administration is responsible for the surplus is nothing but simple pure comedy. I think of myself as a person who recognizes and appreciates humor. I certainly did not mind laughing at the President's stand-up comedy routine yesterday. But we have thrown back the curtain and we have seen that the voice behind the curtain is a very same voice whose only budget proposal projected a $241 billion deficit for this year. Mr. Speaker, it is time to get back to reality. It is the Republican Congress and Republican leadership that deserves the credit for this surplus. It was their commitment in 1995 to get this country on the right track back toward fiscal responsibility and fiscal stability.|105128|971021|10|Hcr21oc97-174 1.txt|162|174|H8904-H8909|800|143|GA|Jack Kingston|H|1|Republican
10519970040674|Mr. Speaker, well, here it is. It is the 109th workday of this Congress in Washington D.C. Thank God we were in session all weekend, although most Members of Congress have not been here. The leadership has not been evident. But that brings the Congress up to a grand total of 109 days. Now, the average American holding only one job, and I have a lot of American families in my district holding two or three jobs trying to make ends meet, but those who are just holding down one job have worked 200 days so far this year. No wonder the Congress' work remains undone. Congress, under the Republican leadership, has worked in Washington, D.C. 109 days. Many of those partial days, like the day that we adjourned at 4 o'clock in the afternoon on a Wednesday because the Republicans had a huge fund-raiser in New York and they had the corporate jets waiting for them out at National Airport, and they all had to jet up to New York and hold this gala event to rake in a few tens of millions of dollars from their corporate sponsors, the same corporate sponsors who wanted them to kill any attempts to curtail teenage smoking and go after the tobacco industry, and the Republican leaders delivered. There is no legislation coming out of this Congress to curtail that, and the rate of teenage smoking is skyrocketing with all the tragic consequences down the road. Then the insurance industry. They provided quite a few jets that afternoon because they had a real big one they wanted to kill. Tens of millions of Americans are in what are called HMOs, health maintenance organizations. What we found out about these HMOs is that they save money by denying Americans and their families and loved ones needed care. The insurance bureaucrats will deny your doctor, will deny you a referral to a specialist, so that they can fatten their bottom line. Tens of millions of Americans were demanding patients' rights. Even the AMA weighed in. They wanted providers' rights. The doctors are fed up with this too. They want to be able to refer their patients for needed tests. But, guess what? The insurance industry is capable of delivering tens of millions of dollars to the Republican leadership, and, behind closed doors, they decided to kill that legislation. There will be no HMO insurance industry Patients and Providers Bill of Rights in this Congress because of special interest money. Now, the chairman of the Committee on Rules rose the other day and said it does not matter that we didn't do HMO reform or anything about teenage smoking. It does not matter that we have not passed the education package to decrease class size, to increase the number of teachers and rebuild our crumbling schools, because we did one big thing in this Congress, we passed a tax cut. Well, let us look at the statistics for the tax cut that was passed by the Republican majority. The families earning less than $59,000, I hope they would all look at their tax return for this year, the 1997 tax year, and compare it to the 1996 tax year and see how much the savings were. Those who got it, about one family in five earning less than $59,000, they got $6. $6. Very generous of the Republican leadership. Now, families between $59,000 and $112,000, they did a little better. They got $81. That is, those of them who got it. That is 20 percent of the families in that tax bracket. But, ah ha, thank God some people really got relief under this bill. Two-thirds of the small number of families in this country earning over $112,000 a year, those whose incomes average $660,000 a year, well, they got a tax cut of $7,135. Very nice. Very nice. It could help pay one year's cost for a kid to go to a state institution of higher learning. Of course, their kids are not going to the state institutions of higher learning. But it could pay for that from one of those other families. The families earning less than $59,000 will get $6 to put toward that education, and those between $59,000 and $112,000 will get $81. So that is the grand accomplishment of this Congress. That is reason enough not to have done anything for education, for class size, for more teachers for the crumbling schools. That is reason enough for the Republican leadership to have denied tens of millions of Americans patients rights when they need a referral to a specialist, when they need a test, when they need treatment. They are denied, with no appeal, and the Republicans have denied them legislation to fix that. It was within the power of this Congress, but the big money spoke louder than the millions of Americans who needed help. Then the teenagers getting hooked on tobacco, well, too bad for them too, according to the Republican leadership. There was not time to take care of that problem.|105458|971105|54|Hcr05no97-42 1.txt|4781|4813|H10001-H10040|2083|366|TN|John Tanner|H|8|Democratic

10519970045480|I thank the Democratic leader. He has provided extraordinary leadership to this caucus and this Congress. The document that we developed over time and announced today with the President, the Vice President, Senator Daschle, Congressman Gephardt, and the joint Democratic caucuses of the House and Senate is one that I am enormously proud of and one that, if enacted, would substantially improve this country. We come here, almost all of us, Democrats and Republicans alike, because we have a passion for public policy and feel very strongly about a range of issues and how those issues might affect our country's future. While we might have substantial differences in how we go about achieving certain goals, I think all of us understand that we sit in this Chamber as American citizens in a democracy wanting the best for our country. The question is, how do we achieve that? How do we achieve the goals that we establish for our country's future? Senator Daschle mentioned the things that we have accomplished, the things that we have yet to do, the fiscal policy. I can recall, going back 5 years to 1993, when we had a very, very significant debate on the floor of the Senate about fiscal policy, what kind of policies would put this country back on track, heading in the right direction; what kind of policies would continue us in the direction that we had been moving in with higher debt, higher deficits, higher unemployment, higher inflation. So we had a significant debate about it. Those of us who felt very strongly that there was a better way and a better direction won by one vote--one vote here and one vote in the other body. A margin of one vote determined the new fiscal policy for this country. It was a tougher fiscal policy. It wasn't words; it was action. So it was controversial. For some, it was difficult. Some of my colleagues who voted for it are not here any longer; they lost their seats in Congress because of it. But it was medicine to cure what was wrong in this country's fiscal policy and to put this country on the right course. And it worked. It substantially reduced the Federal budget deficit. It told all the American people that there was a new group of Members of Congress, a new President who said there is a better way and a different way, and we are going to tackle this fiscal policy and tackle the Federal budget deficit and change things. It's very interesting that, because this economy rides on a cushion of confidence, when we made that decision, the American people were confident about the future once again, and when they are confident, they make decisions like buying a home, buying a car, taking a vacation, buying a new refrigerator. When they are not confident about the future, they don't make those purchases and they don't make those decisions. When they feel like that, the economy contracts. When they feel confident about the future, the economy expands. Because the economy has expanded and because people have had more confidence, this budget deficit has shrunk. It is down, down, down, way down. We will balance the budget. Crime is down, unemployment is down, inflation is down, welfare is down. All of the things that are important in our lives about how we are doing in this country show signs of substantial improvement and show signs that this country is moving in the right direction. I want to make one other point about fiscal policy and some of the other problems we face. In our agenda, we talk about Social Security-- ``save Social Security first,'' the President proposes. And ``save Social Security first,'' we propose as a caucus. Some wring their hands every day of the week about Social Security. Some never liked it in the first place. Some think it doesn't work and they wring their hands and say, ``Woe, what are we to do with Social Security?'' I want them to understand, as many Americans do, that the Social Security problem that exists is born of enormous success. We would not have a problem financing Social Security for 150 years if we went back to the old mortality rates. In the 1930s, you were expected to live to age 63 in this country. Now you are expected to live, on average, to about 77 years in America. Why? Because we have done a lot of good things in this country. We have invested in health care, technology, and breathtaking medical research. Now people, when they reach a certain age and their knees wear out, they get new knees, or they get new hips, or have cataract surgery, or their heart muscle is unplugged on an operating table. Some people may be worth a million dollars after all that medical help. But the point is that people are living longer and better lives, and all of these problems are born of the success of greater longevity. Does that cause some pinching in Social Security and Medicare in the long term? Yes, but it is not catastrophic. Adjustments can be made that are not significant, which will provide solid, assured financing for Social Security and Medicare for the long term. That is what this President says. As we tame the fiscal policy deficits, and as we begin to accumulate surpluses, let us use those surpluses to save Social Security first. Those who believe that is not a wise course, those who believe that is not appropriate fiscal policy, come to the floor of the Senate, because we are going to have a healthy and aggressive debate about that. Many of us feel very strongly that it is precisely what this country ought to do. We have tamed the Federal deficit. Now let's make the right investment. And the first commitment ought to be to save Social Security first. Now, within the context of other spending we do in the budgets and other investments, there are other things we can do. I know we will have Members who don't want to do anything. They have never wanted to do anything. I mean, there are people who have said there is no role for Government. There are people who put seatbelts on when they drive through a car wash. They're so conservative they don't want to do anything ever. Much of what we have accomplished in this country has been because we have made the right kind of investments. This proposal that we have developed jointly says that one of those investments that is very important is in the area of health care research down at the National Institutes of Health, where breathtaking, new medical research occurs. We are saying we can invest substantially more money and you can, as a result of that, save an enormous amount of money and save lives and improve the lives of the American people. I am very excited about that. What better investment is there in this country than to invest in the kind of medical and health care research at the National Institutes of Health which has provided breakthroughs in medicine that have allowed people to live much longer and more productive lives? Another investment that the President and we call for in our joint policy message is an investment in education. Education is our future. Our children are our future. Investment in our children represents our tomorrow. We talk about investing in schools, investing in good teachers, and deciding that we can do this country a significant amount of good by understanding that the priority is educating our children. Thomas Jefferson once said, ``Anyone who believes a country can be both ignorant and free believes in something that never was and never can be.'' He was right about that 200 years ago. The reason this country has done so well is because we have always established that education is a priority. It must remain a priority, and that is what our caucus and our policy choices are committed to doing. A couple of other items--and I don't want to cover them all because some of my colleagues will cover some. Teen smoking is part of our agenda. We need to end that, to combat teen smoking. You have all heard the message that you don't find people deciding at age 25, as they sit around in a recliner thinking about life, or wondering what on Earth can I do to further enrich my life, or what is missing from my life, and they come up with the answer: Smoking; I would like to start smoking. Nobody does that at age 25 or 30. If you are not smoking by the time you are a kid, you are not going to be a future user of tobacco. The tobacco companies have always known that, and that is why they have always targeted their future customers, who are the children. Does anybody know anybody who is 25 or 30 years of age who says, how can I enrich my life further? and then comes up with the answer that I would like to start smoking? Nobody does that. We also understand that we can save lives by combating teen smoking, and there are plenty of ways to do that. A thousand kids a day will die--3,000 kids a day will start smoking, and a thousand will die of that cause. We can save lives with a national campaign to combat teen smoking. Drunk driving. This agenda of ours also deals with the question of drunk driving. That is not some mysterious illness or disease. We know what causes fatalities on the roads--drunk driving. Everyone in this Chamber and every family represented here knows that--friend, neighbor, relative, acquaintance. I am not even very logical about this question. The night that I got the call that my mother had been killed by a drunk driver, I'll never forget the moment, and I'll never forget how I have felt from that day forward. People who drink and drive turn automobiles into instruments of murder. The fact is, it's not just the .08 we are going to debate, the question of when are you drunk. There are six States in this country where you can get behind the wheel of a car and take a fifth of whiskey in one hand and the steering wheel in the other and drive off, and you are perfectly legal. That ought not happen anywhere in America. We can change that. There are some 20 States in which, if the driver can't drink, everybody else in the car can be drinking. Vehicles on roads in this country ought not to have open containers of alcohol in them, period. That is something we can address in this Congress. Finally, campaign finance reform is also part of what our caucus is committed to doing. There are a lot of discussions about what pieces will work and what pieces will not work with respect to campaign finance reform. I want to describe one little piece that I think is important. The most significant kind of air pollution in America today is the 30-second political ad that does nothing but tear down someone's opponent. It is a 30-second slash and burn, cut and run ad that contributes nothing to our country. The first amendment gives everybody the right to do that. We won't change that. But there is a little thing we can change. We can, by Federal law, say that every television station is required to offer the lowest rates on the rate card during political advertising during a certain period. I propose that we change that law to say that low rate is only available to candidates who run advertisements that are at least 1 minute in length. Let's require people to say something significant in one in which the candidate himself or herself is in the advertisement 75 percent of that 1 minute. Some people may not like that. I do. Can you think of any other business, other than American politics, where the competitor says--for example, can you conceive of a car company who does all of its advertising saying: By the way, if you buy a Chevrolet, you are going to kill yourself because they are not safe; or fly American, or United, or Northwest and, by the way, their mechanics are a bunch of drunks. Do we see that in any other part of our lives? No. That is not the way commercial enterprises compete against each other. But it is the way we compete in politics. Shame on us. We can change that. It ought to be a competition of ideas and about what we want for the future of this country. I hope one of these days we can have campaign finance reform that gets to that point. But at least a little proposal I am suggesting, on top of all of the other things that we are talking about in campaign finance reform as a caucus, might finally stop some of this air pollution or at least lessen the pollution that permeates every campaign in this country. Then there is food safety, clean air, and clean water. Our caucus stands for things that are positive in the lives of the American people. Some say they want to debate politics with the same old stereotypes. Unfortunately, it won't work anymore. To those who say, ``There are the good guys, and there are the tax-and-spend people,'' I say that doesn't work. Our caucus, in this Congress, with this President, made a decision that we were going to do some awfully important things to put this country back on course, and we did it--at great cost and expense to our caucus. But the American people, 5 years later, see the results for this country of what we have done. We say that the job isn't finished. There is much to do to make this a better country. That is the purpose of the message and the purpose of the set of public policies that tell the American people: Here is why we are here and what we want to fight for to improve America's future. I yield the floor to the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd.|105900|970205|2|Scr05fe97-158 1.txt|120|121|S1045-S1046|71|14|NA|Speaker|NA|NA|N/A
10519970045776|Mr. President, the debate that we begin today on campaign finance reform must be prefaced with one question: To what extent, if any, should the Federal Government regulate political speech in our country? The President has endorsed Senator McCain and Senator Feingold's campaign finance reform legislation. However, I cannot. Campaign finance reform debate is not just about politicians and their campaigns. At the core of this issue is the First Amendment. The government must tread lightly in attempts to place limitations on speech. The government can no more dictate how many words a newspaper can print than it can limit a political candidate's ability to communicate with his or her constituents The McCain-Feingold legislation bristles with over a dozen different restrictions on speech--provisions that, I believe, flagrantly violate the First Amendment as interpreted by the Supreme Court. I cannot overemphasize this point. George F. Will, in a Washington Post editorial stated of the McCain Feingold bill: Mr. President, I would point out that the 1996 presidential system of campaign finance clearly reveals that two significant problems exists with our current election process: 1. Too much money is spent on campaigns; and 2. Current laws are not enforced. Unfortunately, McCain-Feingold would do little to end the vicious cycle of fundraising. In fact, if anything, it would only prolong the campaign calendar. Since McCain-Feingold contains restrictions on express advocacy'' financed by soft money only 60 days before an election--that will mean that money will simply be raised earlier in the calendar year, and the election season will seem virtually unending. And what is ``express advocacy?'' If this proposal ever becomes law, we can change the name of the Federal Election Commission to the Federal Campaign Speech Police. Every single issue advertisement will be taped, reviewed, analyzed and litigated over. The Speech police will set up their offices in all 50 states to ensure the integrity of political advertising. Is that what we in this chamber really want? I don't think so. But that is what will inevitably happen if we adopt McCain-Feingold. Mr. President, the political tactics and schemes of the 1996 Presidential election campaign reveal the abuses involved in our current system. Bottom-line, our current election laws are not being enforced. It's interesting to note that where the lack of law enforcement has become the most apparent is in the one area that receives guaranteed federal funding via a tax subsidy--federal presidential elections. As grand jury indictments amass with regard to Democratic fundraising violations in the 1996 Presidential election, we learn more and more about President Clinton's use of the perquisites of the Presidency as a fund-raising tool. It's important to recall some of those abuses as we begin our debate on campaign reform. And please keep in mind my point here is existing campaign laws are not being enforced. First, the Lincoln bedroom. During the five years that President Clinton has resided in the White House, an astonishing 938 guests have spent the night in the Lincoln bedroom, and generated at least $6 million to the Democrat National Committee. Presidential historian, Richard Norton Smith, stated that there has ``never been anything of the magnitude of President Clinton's use of the White House for fundraising purposes. . .it's the selling of the White House.'' Presidential Coffees. President Clinton hosted 103 ``presidential coffees.'' Guests at these coffees, which included a convicted felon and a Chinese businessman who heads an arms-trading company, donated $27 million to the Democrat National Committee. President Clinton's Chief of Staff, Harold Ickes, recently turned over a large number of documents that show figures for both expected and actual donations from nearly every White House coffee. Mr. Ickes gave the President weekly memorandums which included projected monies he expected each ``Clinton coffee'' would raise. He projected each would raise no less than $400,000. Here's a comparison: President Bush hosted one ``presidential coffee.'' No money was raised. The cost was $6.24. Foreign Contributions. Investigations by both the Senate Government Affairs Committee and the Department of Justice into campaign abuses in the 1996 presidential campaign have revealed that the Democrats recklessly accepted illegal foreign donations in exchange for presidential access and other favors. A few examples: First John Huang. John Huang, raised millions of dollars in illegal foreign contributions for the Democratic National Committee , which the DNC has already returned. Huang, despite being wholly unqualified according to his immediate boss, received an appointment to the Department of Commerce, where he improperly accessed numerous classified documents on China. Huang made at least 67 visits to the White House, often meeting with senior officials on US trade policy. Senator Specter stated that the activities of Mr. Huang at the Commerce Department had ``all the earmarks of. . .espionage.'' Second Charlie Trie. Longtime friend of Bill Clinton, raised and contributed at least $640,000 contributions to Clinton, Gore and the DNC. Shortly thereafter, Clinton signed an executive order to increase the size of the US Commission on Pacific Trade and appointed Trie to the Commission. On January 29th of this year, the Department of Justice indicted Trie on charges that he funneled illegal foreign contributions to the 1996 Clinton-Gore reelection campaign in order to buy access to top Democratic Party and Clinton Administration officials. Vice President Gore was present at an event at a Buddhist Temple where $80,000 in contributions to the DNC were laundered through penniless nuns and monks. Vice President Gore offered differing characterizations of the Buddhist Temple event. First, the vice-president described the event as a ``community outreach.'' He later characterized it as a ``donor- maintenance'' event where ``no money was offered or collected or raised at the event.'' However, last week, the Department of Justice determined otherwise. On February 18, veteran Democratic fundraiser Maria Hsia was charged in a six-count indictment by the Justice Department for her part in raising the illegal contributions for the Democrat National Committee at the Buddhist Temple event. These abhorrent abuses in our current campaign laws must end. Healthy reform can begin with this debate. So my point is that current laws are not being enforced. Mr. President, there is clearly one area where reform is certainly needed. During the 1996 election, the AFL-CIO spent $35 million to defeat Republican candidates. Where did the AFL-CIO get the resources to fund this campaign? From the dues of both union and nonunion members. Were these hard-working Americans asked by their unions how those dues should be spent? We all know the answer--No. The leaders of the AFL-CIO, headquartered here in Washington, just sat down and decided they would use their members' dues to target Republicans, whether those due-paying workers liked it or not. I believe this practice should end. I applaud Senator Lott for offering a sensible alternative. The Lott Substitute requires full public disclosure. Just as someone cannot donate money to a campaign in someone else's name under existing law, the Lott Amendment would close the loophole for labor unions by requiring that members approve of ads that their dues are spent on. Mr. President, it is my intention to offer amendments to this bill that will address several issues related to campaign finance reform. One of those amendments will address what I believe is a fundamental inequity in the rules governing Senatorial activities. The amendment I will offer will conform the rules that we have for transportation and lodging in connection with a charitable event with the rules that exist for transportation and lodging in connection with a political event, such as a political fundraiser something we all know. Under rules we adopted in 1995, private entities cannot reimburse Members for the cost of transportation and lodging to a charitable event. But, members are still permitted to be privately reimbursed if they travel to a fundraising event for another member. In other words, lobbyists and PAC Committee contributions can be used to reimburse members for taking a night off and flying to Hollywood for political fundraisers. Under the Senate Ethics Committee's Interpretative Ruling No. 193, a Senator may accept travel expenses from an official of a district's political party organization in return for his appearance at a rally sponsored by the organization. Now, Mr. President, every Member of this body has at one time or another made a campaign appearance for his or her party or for a candidate of his party. Often, that means flying to another Member's home state, attending a party function; maybe making a speech and sharing a meal; maybe attending an entertainment or sports function. And the entire cost is almost always covered by lobbyists and other political contributors. So we have a situation where a Senator can travel all over the country attending political fundraisers and have lodging and transportation reimbursed, but a Senator can't attend charity events-- events that raise money for very worthwhile causes such as breast cancer detection--and have those costs reimbursed. Does that make sense? Why is it all right for a political action committee to host a $500 a plate political fundraiser, or give a campaign check for $5,000 to an elected official, but there can be no solicitation of corporations and other individuals to participate in a charitable event that only benefits a small community or state? I believe this whole notion of preventing Senators and corporations from sharing in raising money for a worthy cause outside the Beltway, but allowing $5,000 and $10,000 political gifts smacks of sheer hypocrisy. Since we adopted this change in our rules, it has become far more difficult for Senators to participate in charitable events. A recent article in Roll Call pointed out that charitable golf and ski events have dried up as a result of our rule change. But as Roll Call notes: ``But Members and their staff can still flock to sports tournaments or wine and dine with lobbyists--as long as it's part of a fundraiser.'' Mr. President, the amendment I intend to offer will end this hypocrisy. My amendment simply provides that Senators would be permitted to be privately reimbursed for the costs of lodging and transportation in connection with charitable fund-raising events in the same manner they can be reimbursed for political travel. This is a very simple amendment. It merely conforms the charitable travel rules with the political travel rules. Mr. President, I believe one of the most important responsibilities of a public official is to promote worthwhile charitable causes. Not everything that can be done for the public good derives from government. Private charities play a vital role in servicing many of the needs of our citizens. In my own case, for the past 4 years, my wife Nancy and I have been the honorary chairs of a fishing tournament in Alaska which has raised $830,000 for a mammogram machine for the Fairbanks Breast Cancer Detection Center and a mobile detection van. And as a result, the center has been was able to provide free breast cancer examinations and mammograms for 25,000 women who from 81 villages in Alaska. The units we've been able to finance have been vital in helping preserve the health of Alaska's women, especially the women in the small villages. The State's cancer mortality is the third highest in the nation--one in eight Alaska women will develop breast cancer. Breast cancer screening can reduce these amounts by 30 percent. I believe that without the money raised from these two fundraisers, the health of Alaska's women would be severely marginalized. I am proud of the work that my wife Nancy has done to get these units operating. If we change the rules on charitable events, I am convinced that neither of these units would have become a reality. What we have here is a situation that discriminates against distant States. Mr. President, even though Senators are permitted to attend charitable events, the rules relating to transportation and lodging clearly discriminate against charitable events in distant States. Large national charitable organizations have the clout and resources to hold events in Washington, D.C. where Members can easily attend. But if you are a small organization, like the Fairbanks Breast Cancer Detection Center or you are not going to have the resources or the capability to have your event held in the Nation's Capital. And if Senators cannot receive transportation and lodging reimbursement, events like mine and events sponsored by other Senators in their home states are just going to disappear because it costs too much to get to Alaska and other small States. Mr. President, I think we have a very clear choice here. Do we want to establish the same lodging and transportation rules for charitable fund raisers as we have for political fundraising? Or do we want to make it harder to raise money for worthy charities, while at the same time continuing the unlimited reimbursement for political fundraising. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support my amendment when it is offered. And I want to assure my colleagues that should my amendment fail, I will offer an amendment to conform the transportation and lodging rules with the charitable rules so that Members will have to pay out of their own pockets to participate in fund raisers for other political candidates. Mr. President, I am hopeful that sensible campaign reform will come forth during this debate--reform that: does not violate free speech rights; provides greater enforcement for current laws; and ends loopholes that circumvent the intent of campaign laws. Any reform taken by this Body must not infringe upon individual liberties. Reform should limit the elected official --not the electorate. The American public deserves no less. I defer to my good friend from Iowa.|105499|970207|1|Scr07fe97-7 1.txt|16|33|S1119|822|145|UT|Orrin Hatch|S|NA|Republican

10519970073991|The Senator from New York Mr. D'AMATO. Madam President, I was tremendously heartened by the vote today on an amendment which would have set back home ownership tremendously. Indeed, by a vote of 69 to 27, the Senate voted to table the amendment offered by Senator Nickles which would have limited FHA insurance to over 50 million Americans. Currently, there are 52.5 million Americans who live in high-cost areas where FHA simply does not reflect the reality of the marketplace. In high cost areas, such as Nassau County, New York the current FHA limit of $170,000 is insufficient because the median cost for a home was $195,000 in 1997. It is nearly impossible for many young families starting out to achieve the American Dream of homeownership. Let me be clear, we are not talking about wealthy families; we are talking about a two-wage-earner couple, just married, a schoolteacher and a police officer--struggling to accumulate the necessary funds for that first downpayment. In many high cost areas, FHA no longer covers the cost for entry- level, new starter homes. In Levittown, Long Island--which epitomized post-war expansion of homeownership for working, middle-class families, especially for GIs returning home from the war--that opportunity, unfortunately, is becoming more difficult today. Even in times where we say the economy is booming and a nationwide rise in homeownership, families in high cost areas are too often being left behind. Indeed, in many of these high cost areas, the homeownership rate is lagging far behind the nationwide average. Young families starting out on their own have to come up with $25,000 for a downpayment--which is very, very difficult to achieve, especially in an area where the cost of living places such a tremendous strain on the family budget. We are not talking about people of affluence. Nor are we talking about magnificent estates or mansions, but simply average median-cost homes. Indeed, in Long Island, where homeownership has been such a key ingredient to permitting people to work and live as part of a community, home ownership is becoming more difficult for these working, middle-class families. It is simply beyond their reach. Thankfully, today we have helped to bring relief to families in high cost areas by raising the FHA limit. In Long Island, the area that I grew up in and live in, where there are nearly 3 million people, we will now be providing greater opportunities for young middle class families to own their own home. The current FHA limit, which is set at $170,000, is simply too low in an area where there are relatively very few homes that can be purchased in all of the island for $170,000 or less. By raising the limit up to $197,000, FHA will better reflect the reality of the marketplace where the median home prices in Nassau and Suffolk Counties were $195,000 in 1997. We will now be providing that opportunity to thousands of young families who will be looking to purchase that first home in Long Island. Nationwide, about 21 percent of the Nation's population lives in high-income areas. Again, this FHA increase in not for the benefit of the affluent--they do not need FHA insurance and will continue to be served by the private market. Indeed, they buy homes that cost much more than $197,000. What we have done is, I believe, struck a blow for home ownership, for young families who want to get an opportunity, from one length of the country to another. The mayor of Albany, Mayor Gerald Jennings, he called me yesterday. He was concerned because of the outlying communities in the Albany area. The county executive from Nassau, Tom Gulotta, called me because his housing experts advised him that too many young families are being denied the opportunity to purchase a home. They need to be able to get FHA insurance for young families who are starting out on their own. I commend the Senate for overwhelmingly supporting this provision by a vote of 69-27 to raise the FHA limits in high cost areas. I believe we achieved a big victory for home ownership throughout this country today. I yield the floor.|105900|970725|3|Scr25jy97-101 1.txt|111|111|S8141|35|6|NA|Speaker|NA|NA|N/A

We have talked privately about this and, quite frankly, I believe we are going to be able to work this out.

I believe we will be able to work this out in a manner that will be, I hope, conducive to getting the money that we need immediately--just the basic requirements that we want for the National Institutes of Health, that we want for LIHEAP, and a lot of the other programs that so many Members support here.

So, Mr. President, with the assurances of my chairman that we will be able to get this thing worked out, I just wanted to refer to one thing on the chart. With the reallocation, with the amount of money we would get from the rescoring, we would have $770 million. That would get us the money that we need for NIH. That would get us the money that we need for LIHEAP and for the other programs--Head Start and others--that we need, which Senators support here.

10519970080899|Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky is now getting into grounds that I love but that some others have sometimes scorned in this debate; that is, the basis of the free speech position of the Constitution of the United States. If I may respond to the Senator from Kentucky by quoting from James Madison and the Federalist Papers that support exactly what he said, they didn't use the term ``special interest'' back in Madison's century. The term of art then was ``faction.'' This is what James Madison had to say: That sounds like the definition of a special interest group to me. Madison goes on to say: Certainly we do not want to eliminate air that we cannot breathe in the name of stopping a fire that might occur, and we do not want to eliminate liberty. So Madison makes that point. Referring to the second, giving everyone the same opinions, passions, and interests, Madison says: Absolutely the Founding Fathers created the Constitution for the sole purpose of protecting the rights of every one to have his own special interest, belong to his own faction, and hold his own opinion. An attempt on the part of the Senate of the United States to destroy that right is clearly going to be held unconstitutional as it has been again and again, as my friend from Kentucky has pointed out so often on the floor.|105900|970925|11|Scr25se97-150 1.txt|55|57|S9960-S9963|171|28|NA|Speaker|NA|NA|N/A

10519980001597|Mr. Speaker, it is obvious why the Republicans drafted this bill. Republicans learned in 1996 that there is a price to pay for practicing the politics of prejudice. Latino voters grew tired of hearing Republicans' red-hot rhetoric and coldhearted legislation targeting our communities, so in response Latinos voted for tolerance, opportunity and equality. In other words, Latinos voted for Democrats. What is the Republican reaction? To change course to end their anti- Latino anti-immigrant behavior? No. Now they want to create unnecessary fear within the Hispanic community and create unwarranted fear of the Hispanic community in the eyes of our fellow Americans. I am not in the business of giving advice to Newt Gingrich, but let me say this: Latino voters are American voters. When we vote, we remember who stood with us and who stood against us. And we are not alone; Americans of diverse backgrounds are united. They detest discrimination, are sick of scapegoating and are fed up with finger- pointing. The Republicans will go on record today not simply as opponents of Latinos but as opponents of the principles that should make each of us proud to be an American. Well, I'll tell you what kind of name Gingrich is--it's an American name. Every bit as American--in fact--as Garcia. Or Morales. Or Jimenez. Each one an American. Each deserving the right to vote. Each deserving of respect. And none deserving of the scapegoating, suspicion, and cynicism that the Republicans have aimed at them with this legislation.

10519980003831|Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege of serving on the board of trustees for the Monroe Regional Medical Center in my hometown of Ocala, Florida. It is an honor for me this morning to take the floor to recognize the 100th anniversary of this wonderful hospital. In 1898, the Marion Surgical Hospital was organized into two rooms on the third floor of an office building in Ocala, Florida. Since then, the hospital has been in different locations under different names but its mission has remained constant, serving the medical needs of those within the community. We are proud that our hospital provides care for patients without regard to race, religion, national origin or financial status. The Monroe Regional Medical Center has changed dramatically from its modest beginnings. It is now a modern 323-bed, acute-care facility. This is a not-for-profit hospital. It is owned and supported by our community. I appreciate this opportunity to pay tribute to the fourth oldest hospital in the State of Florida for 100 years of service. Congratulations.|105108|980311|1|Hcr11mr98-49 1.txt|18|34|H1025|1046|171|FL|Cliff Stearns|H|6|Republican

10519980015558|Mr. Speaker, first of all I want to thank the gentleman from Kentucky , who more than anyone has put in long years to bring this legislation to the floor. It is a great tribute to him and his efforts. Mr. Speaker, every American should have the right to aspire to the American dream. In America, every citizen should have the opportunity to participate in our economy to the extent of their talent or abilities. Unfortunately, many individuals with disabilities have had the American dream recede beyond their reach, not because of physical limitations but because of roadblocks created within our system of social services. These artificial barriers unfairly and unnecessarily reduce workforce participation and economic opportunity for many Americans whose disability should not bar them from gainful employment. Mr. Speaker, in my view the time has come to empower these Americans to participate fully in the broad emporium of our national economy. I rise in strong support of the Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Act. This bipartisan bill establishes a new program that will provide SSDI and SSI disabled beneficiaries with a ticket to a variety of support services, enabling these beneficiaries to reenter the workforce. Private sector providers, known as employment networks, would be established to assist beneficiaries, and the Social Security Administration would contract with program managers to administer the Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program nationwide. The program will include vocational rehabilitation and employment services, and beneficiaries would be in a position to choose the service provider that they would like to participate in. This will create competition and improve quality. The Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program would pay employment networks for results, rather than merely for the cost of their services. It also contains a significant demonstration project that allows the disabled to maintain their benefits while earning more at work than allowed under current law. Right now, we have a situation which I consider obscene. Once a Social Security disability beneficiary reaches an income level of only $500 a month, all of their cash benefits are cut off. This has the effect of retarding workforce participation by recipients and punishing hard work and ambition among some of our most vulnerable citizens. Under this bill, Social Security would be required to conduct a demonstration project to study the effects of replacing that income cliff with a $1 for $2 withholding of benefits for earnings at the current cutoff level. Instead of a cliff, it would be a slope, and we know intuitively that more people would be able to participate. This is balanced and much-needed legislation that finally begins to address the needs of disabled individuals who want to work, but are discouraged from doing so by a variety of irrational roadblocks. I urge passage of this legislation.|105433|980603|24|Hcr03jn98-104 1.txt|2973|3019|H4005-H4024|2935|464|PA|Philip English|H|21|Republican

10519980020929|Mr. Chairman, I would like to address a couple of points that have been made. When discussing 486, the words ``safe'' and ``effective'' have been used. I want us to think about what those words mean. Safe and effective for whom? They are not safe for women. They cause tremendous pain, tremendous discomfort, tremendous risk for blood transfusion, tremendous risk for instrumentation, and tremendous risk to the remaining fetuses and children who will be born outside of that complication. The other thing that was said, and words tell us a whole lot, what was said is if we cannot use this medical form of abortion, it is a limitation on contraception. That was made in an earlier statement, which tells us exactly what people mean. Abortion is a method of contraception in this country. The taking of innocent human life is used as a method of contraception. I would make two points. The Supreme Court said they did not know when life began. But we know when life ends in this country, when there is not a heartbeat and there is not a brain wave. Well, there is a brain wave at 41 days post-conception, and there is a heartbeat at 26 days post-conception, before most women know they are pregnant. There is no question, life is present when RU-486 will be applied. Should the government be in the business be of killing unborn babies? I think not.|105398|980624|208|Hcr24jn98-63 1.txt|2828|2850|H5075-H5100|1349|238|OK|Tom Coburn|H|2|Republican

I think it is symbolic, maybe, that the President told them ``symbolically'' that we do not care that they are building the biggest nuclear arsenal in the world; and we do not care that they are selling that technology to people around the world; and ``symbolically'' the President was also saying that we do not care that they are invading a little nation like Tibet, that never hurt anybody, and have occupied it for all these years; and ``symbolically'' he is saying that we do not care that they persecute people because of their faith and their beliefs and religion; and he is telling them ``symbolically'' that we do not care that they threatened Taiwan, that could not do them any damage, and that they even threatened the cities on the West Coast of the United States; and ``symbolically'' the President said, oh, it is okay that their army gave money to his reelection campaign. And to show them ``symbolically'' that we do not mind any of this, we are going to give them some missile technology to help their intercontinental ballistic missiles function more appropriately.

10519980049724|Madam President, I thank my colleagues for unanimously adopting this resolution. I believe this vote of 100 to 0 lets Thailand and the Thai people know the heartfelt sentiments of the Senate and the American people toward bilateral friendship and partnership. It also makes clear our recognition of the strides Bangkok has been making in executing its responsibilities under its arrangements with the International Monetary Fund. Only last week, for example, Thailand deepened its commitment to economic reform by pledging to speed up privatizations and the reorganization of its banking system. This week the new Prime Minister of Thailand, Chuan Leekpai, will visit the United States. Many of us will have the chance to meet him when he comes to visit Capitol Hill. While Prime Minister Chuan faces many challenges in the coming months and years, I hope and trust the support for Thailand that he will find in this country will help him in overcoming those challenges. As I have said before, I believe that all of us in this Chamber--and Americans all across this land--are great admirers of Thailand and Thai culture. I remain optimistic about Thailand's future.

10519980051198|Mr. President, it's Friday noontime, and I want to make clear that the eyes of the Nation are going to be on the Senate of the United States next Tuesday when we will vote on a proposal that will provide a $1.6 billion tax cut that will mostly benefit the wealthy individuals who send their children to private school. That is $1.6 billion that could be used to support our public school system. I think it's important for the Nation that parents review what has happened in the U.S. Senate over the last few days. Some very important decisions have been made by the Budget Committee. They have decided how to allocate the nation's scarce federal resources--and education doesn't get its fair share. And, next week, we will be voting on this $1.6 billion tax break that will primarily benefit the private schools. I take issue with those who believe we ought to support the Budget Committee's decision to cut $1.6 billion from education. We should not abandon the public schools in this country. No challenge we face as a Nation is more important than strengthening the academic achievement and accomplishment of the young people in this country--the 48 million young people who attend the public schools in this country every single day. On the one hand, Republicans want to use $1.6 billion to support for tax breaks to help private schools. And, at the same time, our Republican friends on the Budget Committee cut federal education funding by $400 million from last year, and $1.6 billion below the President's level. Those who are making the speeches about the importance of public schools, if they stand behind the public school system, are going to have to answer the questions why they continue to cut crucial support for education. Now, look at what the Budget Committee provided in this past week. We will have the chance to debate the budget when it comes up here in the next several days. But let's look at where our Republican friends place their priorities and what they said about public education. They cut $1.6 billion below President Clinton's budget on public education. Now, money is not always the final indicator about what is a good program or what is a bad program; we recognize that. But it is a pretty good indication about where a nation's priorities are. If we go out and start to cut, as the Budget Committee did this past week, $1.6 billion in discretionary assistance for the public schools, we know that education is not a national priority. That means that they cut education and Head Start funding by $1 billion below the level needed just to maintain the current services. In order for communities to be able to continue to serve the current number of children in Head Start, you would need an additional $1 billion just to meet inflation. Right now, we provide enough funding in Head Start to serve about 40 percent of all the children that are eligible. But now some of those children currently in Head Start programs won't get the help the need. Now, the Head Start Program doesn't solve all of our problems in early education. But what is undeniable is the importance of early intervention with children. What we have seen with the various Carnegie Commission reports, and the other reports, is that the earlier the intervention, the more confidence young children will have. The Head Start Program is a tried and tested program. If a chid gets help in the Head Start Program, they are more likely to succeed in school and as adults. All you have to do is look at the Ypsilanti programs, the Beethoven project, and various other studies that have been done, and they show what the importance is in terms of early intervention. This Republican budget cuts $1 billion out of that Head Start Program and other important education programs. It also cuts funding for the education programs $400 million below even last year. It prohibits funding for any of the new programs. So we are having a reduction of $1.6 billion in discretionary funding for education, which includes cuts in the Head Start Program. That Head Start Program has had bipartisan support. President Bush increased it $300 million or $400 million a year. We ran into problems during that period of time that we weren't giving sufficient support and help for those teachers that were involved in those programs. And some of the quality issues were important to address, but we addressed them in a bipartisan way. We also indicated in the reauthorization of the Head Start Program some special funding for the earliest interventions, going down to 3-year-olds and 2-year-olds. That was very important. But this Budget Committee says no to those programs, no to even those that are in those programs, by cutting back funding. The President of the United States is working hard to address the challenges that we are facing out in our public schools, particularly that we are going to need additional teachers in our schools and we need to rebuild the nation's school buildings. Because of enrollments rising and massive teachers retirements, we are going to need 100,000 new teachers. The President has committed enough funding for 100,000 new teachers in his budget to reduce class sizes in the early grades. The President of the United States said, let's try a smaller class size for the early years, when the children are just beginning their education experience and they need more individual attention. But, the Republican Budget Committee has said no to the 100,000 new teachers and no to smaller class sizes. Then the President of the United States introduced a plan to help disadvantaged communities--urban or rural--improve failing schools. A number of communities across this country, such as Chicago and my own city of Boston, are making dramatic improvements in educational opportunities for children. The President's program for creating educational opportunity zones is one of the most important investments we can make to get quick help for tough reform in these needy communities. The President has proposed help for local communities that are going to take some dramatic steps to try to enhance academic achievement. He calls them ``education opportunity zones.'' We have the record on these, where these are being tried across the country to try to provide additional help and support for those teachers. That program won't be given a chance to get off the ground. There won't be a nickel for that program that was advanced by the President of the United States. Senator Moseley-Braun has introduced a very important program to modernize and rebuild the nation's schools. That is very important in every community in this country--whether you have to address overcrowded or crumbling schools. I believe that my own State has the second oldest schools in this country. We find that on a cold day where the temperature goes down to 20 degrees in Boston that 10 or 15 schools in Boston are effectively closed because of poor heating systems. Those children have to stay home. We are talking about a very modest program that will bring $22 billion in bonding authority to the states interest-free. Senator Carol Moseley-Braun has been fighting for that day in and day out. But, the Republicans refuse to make a strong investment in rebuilding the nation's schools. There is no funding for the High Hopes School College Partnership Program to help young people from disadvantaged communities reach their dream of going to college. There is no increase in the Title I funding to improve students achievement in math and reading. What has to happen before Republicans will stop the attack on public education? The Third International Math and Science Study was just released that shows our students aren't measuring up. We have had hours and days of discussion, and volumes of reports, that talk about the importance of early intervention programs, and the importance of programs that provide extra help in areas of math reading, and science. The Title I program for needy children has made a tremendous difference in the reading and math skills of young people. We have been reminded as a nation about the importance of furthering our efforts in math and science. And yet, Title I and other important programs will not get an increase. The Republican budget won't even allow for an increase in Pell grants that are so crucial to helping needy college students afford to go to college. About 80 percent of the children in the highest income bracket finish college, but only about 8 percent of students in the lowest 25 percent finish college. Many of those students cannot afford to finish. But the Republicans won't help more needy students get the assistance they need. I can remember not long ago, at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, their tuition used to be $1,100. They raised it to $1,200, and they lost 10 percent of all their applicants--$100. What is the profile of those students? Eighty-five percent of those students' parents never went to college, and 85 percent of them are working 25 hours a week, or more. One hundred dollars makes a major difference. A modest increase in the Pell grants, even an increase of $300, is a lifeline to those young people so that they can finish college and get good jobs. All of these programs that the Republicans have rejected or frozen are paid for in the President's budget. They are paid for. But, nonetheless, we see that the Budget Committee said no --no to each one of the President's programs to try to strengthen education. Then we are faced with billions of dollars of cuts from the President's levels. And at the same time, the Republican program provides a tax break for the wealthiest individuals in this country. And for what? To help improve public education? No! To subsidize the private school tuition they already pay. If that makes sense, then my colleagues should vote for cloture next week. But every parent in this country ought to know what is happening on education, and every parent ought to know that we are being closed down from any opportunity to debate this issue--the most important debate we are going to be facing. It is Friday afternoon. We are going to have a little time to speak here on Friday afternoon, and a only little time before the cloture vote on Tuesday. Education is a key issue and it deserves a long debate. And, it deserves the discussion of other ideas, not just one way. Mr. President, I can't believe that as an institution and as representatives of the people we constantly talk about education but our first order of business in education is to provide a tax break of $1.6 billion that does nothing to improve public schools. This is their education program: nothing to strengthen teachers; nothing to reduce class size; nothing to modernize and rebuild schools; nothing to expand after-school programs; cutting back on the Head Start Program that provides skills for children to go into the public school system. They say that this is their answer to their education. And we are being denied the opportunity to debate it. Mr. President, I think this is really the kind of irresponsible approach on education that really does an enormous disservice to the parents in this country. We should improve our public schools, not abandon them. I see my good friend from Connecticut on the floor who serves on the Labor and Human Resources Committee that governs education issues, and who has been tireless in advancing the cause of education. I am wonder if he is not as perplexed by the allocation of this $1.6 billion. As I understand, the Joint Tax Committee has stated that the bill spends $1.6 billion to allocate to private schools. Of the 35.4 million public school families, only 30 percent would be able to use this IRA. And those public school families would only get an average benefit of $7-- $7 per family. Of the 2.9 million who send their children to private schools, 83 percent will be able to use it. And the private school families will get an average benefit of $37. I am just wondering if he is not as perplexed by that whole approach and that whole program--and the allocations of the benefits of this program--and whether he would agree with me that this really is a sham. When we talk about trying to strengthen academic achievement, academic accomplishment, and investment in the young people of this country in our public school system, is this what we should accept?|105237|980320|1|Scr20mr98-17 1.txt|16|208|S2358-S2362|12408|2114|MA|Edward Kennedy|S|NA|Democratic

10519980067365|Mr. President, I was initially going to seek to dispense with the reading of the resolution. But it sounds so good that I could not help to want to hear and allow our gallery to hear, as well, those words. We in Michigan, and hockey fans, I think, throughout the world, are excited by the victory Tuesday night of the Detroit Red Wings in the Stanley Cup hockey finals. Earlier today, Senator Levin, on his behalf and my own, introduced a resolution to commemorate that victory. I will not take the time of the Senate to read the entire text of that resolution again. But I would like to stand here today to acknowledge and express the pride that he and I and the Detroit Red Wings fans, not only in Michigan but everywhere else, have as the team on Tuesday won its second consecutive Stanley Cup hockey championship. Last Friday, I had the opportunity to host the visit of the Stanley Cup itself to the Senate. We had the chance to share with our colleagues a little bit about the history of that most ancient trophy, which commemorates each year the winner of hockey's ultimate championship. As I say, this is the second straight year that championship has been won by the Detroit Red Wings. It is also the second straight year that the Red Wings have won the championship with a four-game sweep, clearly an indication of the talent and the abilities of this team. I think this year's victory was also special for a variety of other reasons that I would like to mention. First, as evident throughout the season and certainly during the final days of the playoffs, this victory was special because of the presence in the players' spirits and minds, and then ultimately at the arena itself, of Vladimir Konstantinov, one of the stars of last year's championship who was innocently the victim of an auto accident and injury that made it impossible for him to play this year. We all wish him a speedy recovery, although he is still wheelchair bound. It was a special win because the players dedicated the season to him and to the team trainer, Sergei Mnatsakanov, who likewise had been injured in that automobile accident. It marked the eighth straight Stanley Cup victory for Scotty Bowman, and that ties him with his mentor, Toe Blake, for the most victories of this championship in the history of the NHL. It was a special victory because team captain Steve Yzerman, in his 15th season, was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy, which is a trophy that goes to the most valuable player in the playoffs. Those of us who have followed Red Wing hockey throughout that time know just how much he has meant not only to Detroit hockey but hockey in the NHL, one of the great players of all time. We in Michigan refer to Detroit as ``Hockeytown U.S.A.'' That has been our designation, but I think this victory, coupled with last year's victory, will make it clear, to everyone who may have had some doubts as to where the ultimate center of hockey spirit in this country is, that at least until they are dethroned, Detroit, MI, is that center and the Detroit Red Wings are the team that deserve the accolades they were able to achieve on Tuesday night. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the resolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the resolution be printed in the Record at the appropriate place as if read.|105256|980618|4|Scr18jn98-130 1.txt|30|84|S6529-S6530|3399|608|MI|Spencer Abraham|S|NA|Republican

Among other things, section 805 would require the Secretary of Defense to issue regulations clarifying the procedures and methods to be used in determining the reasonableness of prices charged for sole-source commercial items. The amendment would provide that the regulations should be issued on a government-wide basis, as a part of the Federal Acquisition Regulation and applicable to all federal procurements, rather than being issued by the Secretary of Defense and applicable only to DoD procurements.

10519980086530|Mr. President, if ironies were flowers the area inside the Washington beltway would be covered with fields of flowers sprouting out of every square inch of land. I am surprised that many of the same Senators who say they want farmers to receive higher income for what they produce strongly oppose the same for other farmers if the product is not produced in their home states. Many Senators have recently spoken on the floor about the disaster facing their farmers. Some have likened it to losses caused by natural disasters such as Hurricanes. Regarding this farm disaster, their biggest concern is the huge loss in farm income. The culprit this time is low prices and the loss of farm income. In speech after speech many complain that their farmers face low prices--and thus low income. And, as is so often said, farmers do not want welfare they want higher income for their labors. These Senators assert that farmers do not just want a handout-- they want higher prices so they can earn an reasonable income and stay in business. Whether the commodity is wheat, soybeans, corn, or other feedgrains we hear time and time again that prices are too low--and thus their farmers may go out of business. There is a sense of great panic in the farm community. It is real. I am advised that farm income in some areas has been reduced by 98 percent. I have been moved by many of the compelling descriptions of the agony faced by these farm families. I am concerned about this even though my home state of Vermont is not as directly affected. Thomas Paine made an interesting comment about these situations which is still as true today as is was in 1776. He said: ``Panics, in some cases, have their uses. . . . their peculiar advantage is, that they are the touchstone of sincerity and hypocrisy, and bring things and men to light, which might otherwise have lain forever undiscovered.'' There is indeed a touch of hypocrisy in this crisis. Some, including some at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, see the loan deficiency payments as a great solution. If prices drop below a target price the farmers get the difference between their market price and this target price. If prices increase above a certain level then the farmers cannot receive this cash payment. Recently I twice voted for these proposals along with every Democratic Senator save one. I do think this approach is a good idea and I hope in the end it is included in any continuing resolution we work out. It is important that any income relief in the resolution be targeted to 1998 year crop production and that it go to producers, not mere landowners. Many strongly support this approach for commodities produced by their farmers. However, if the benefit is to be provided to farmers not producing their commodities some turn a deaf ear. This is an unfortunate irony--some will not listen to the very arguments they use to support additional income to their farmers if other commodities are involved. I voted for their solution even though it is of little benefit to my home state of Vermont. Turning a deaf ear toward farm problems in other areas of the country raises a lot of concerns. The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact is the perfect example. The major benefit of the compact is to provide income to farmers when milk prices are low--income is not provided to farmers when prices rise past a certain point. The amount of the payment a farmer gets depends on how far milk prices are below the target price. You could simply repeat those two sentences but substitute the word ``corn,'' ``soybeans'' or ``wheat,'' or whichever commodity, for ``milk'' and you have described how the loan deficiency payment system works. Many certainly want this benefit for their commodities. Some Senators would rather their farmers get a check for increased ``freedom to farm payments'' instead of cash payments called loan deficiency payments. In this way these Senators provide cash to feedgrains producers to make up for the fact that farm prices are so low. Either way, almost all Senators want farmers to receive some additional cash payments. And farms families deserve this. But try to apply this system to milk prices and many Members of Congress and some in the Administration say ``no.'' This is a major issue for me since more than 70 percent of all farm income in my state is from dairy. Vermont is first in the nation in terms of the relative importance of dairy to total farm income. This is why the Compact is crucial to me. Dairy farmers like other farmers work hard--milking cows early in the morning, moving cows around to pasture, feeding them, worrying about veterinary bills. I wish we could all work together on this matter--all areas of the country--and support farm income for all producers. I freely admit that the Compact does give dairy farmers a lot more income when prices are low. It is supposed to do that--just like loan deficiency payments. We are not concealing the fact that during the first 6 months of operation OMB reported that ``New England dairy farm income rose by an estimated $22-27 million . . . .'' Several Senators from the Upper Midwest insisted that OMB do a study on the effects of the Compact. The OMB report is called the ``The Economic Effects of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact.'' I will be quoting a lot from that study that those Senators wanted in this floor statement. As a little background, the Interstate Dairy Compact Commission with 26 delegates appointed by the six governors is authorized to determine a ``target price''--$16.94/cwt in this case. Under the Compact language approved by the six states any state can opt-out temporarily--until a later date that the state determines--or opt-in and receive that additional income for producers. The Compact is voluntary, it is up to each state. As I just pointed out in this respect, when prices are low the effect of the Compact is similar to the loan deficiency payments made under marketing loan programs in that, roughly speaking, producers get the difference between a ``capped'' target amount and the current price. When farm prices are high, no cash payments are made to producers under the Compact. Why is this additional income for dairy farmers as justifiable as additional income--whether in the form of loan deficiency payments or increased freedom to farm payments--for feedgrain farmers? The answer is simple--it keeps their families on the farm. All farmers deserve to earn a decent income for their families. This additional income to farmers in New England based on the Compact has kept farmers in business. For example, news articles have focused on how in Connecticut and Vermont the rate of farm loss is much less than before the Compact went into effect. Before the Compact, OMB reports that New England suffered a ``20-percent decline'' in the number of farms with milk cows from 1990 to 1996. Now, this horrible rate of attrition has stopped. I wish other states could also stop their loss of farm families. I have supported reasonable efforts to keep family farmers in business throughout our country and will insist on that in any continuing resolution. It is clear that efforts to keep dairy farmers in business will become more critical over time since, as OMB reports, ``the Farm Bill also calls for the termination of many elements of USDA's current dairy program by January 2000.'' Also, dairy producers do not receive any so- called ``freedom to farm payments" for milk production and the milk support program will be terminated in the year 2000. Also, since dairy farmers sell a perishable fluid product that needs refrigeration they are not able to hold product off the market until they can get a better price. Feedgrains can be and are stored to get a better price--indeed the government will even give you a loan based on the value of the grain you are storing. This provides farmers with cash to pay bills--this program is not available regarding the production of milk. Of course, by taking this grain off the market this can have the effect of increasing grain prices. FAPRI has provided Congress with information on these anticipated increases in grain prices based on the marketing loan program. One disadvantage to increasing the caps in marketing loan programs, or increasing freedom to farm payments, is that it costs taxpayers a bundle--in this case several billion dollars. I voted for the marketing loan proposals twice because I think it is worth it to increase farm income in Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Missouri and a number of other states. While marketing loan programs do not benefit New England dairy farmers, I have always felt that farmers should stick together and help each other out. I wish more Members of Congress felt that way. I am very willing to work with my Colleagues from the Upper Midwest to try to figure a way so that all of us can work together. But I will insist on one thing--that our goal should be to protect income for dairy farmers and to keep farmers in business. I do have some ideas that I think we can all agree upon and want to sit down with my Colleagues from the Upper Midwest, and around the country, to work something out. I will support reasonable programs that benefit their farmers, as I do farmers in others states and as I do for other commodities. As long as I am on the subject of the Compact I want to make a few additional points about how well it is working. First, I want to thank many of the Members of Congress who want to support farm income for all farmers--not just farmers producing feedgrains. I am very pleased that the Compact will get a short extension in the appropriations bill. Some opponents have begun complaining that it is included in the Agriculture Appropriations bill. It was included in the House bill and is now included in the Conference Report. I am very pleased with this since the 1996 farm bill created a three- year Compact pilot project for the Northeast. However, long delays in implementing the Compact by USDA have cut that three-year period down to less than two years. That is not what the Congress had in mind when it passed a three-year time period in 1996. I am pleased that this Appropriations Bill will extend the Compact at least until September 30, 1999, so that the Congress can find out how well it has served farmers. Even with this extension, the time-period is less than Congress set forth in 1996. It is interesting that one of my distinguished Colleagues blasted the Compact on the Senate floor by saying that dairy farmers have not seen positive benefits as a result of the compact. What surprises me about this statement is that most dairy farmers would say that a significant increase in their income over a six-month period was a ``positive benefit.'' Maybe things are different in the Upper Midwest but New England farmers like this increase in income and consider higher income a positive benefit. It could be that since New England only produces three percent of the fluid milk in the nation that an increase of $22 million to $27 million in income over a six month period, according to OMB, is not considered large by Upper Midwest standards. I also disagree with the complaint that under the Compact ``consumers have been hurt by higher prices.'' OMB has an answer for that which proves the value of the Compact. OMB reported after an initial increase in prices at some stores just as the Compact was implemented that: ``New England retail milk prices by December [the sixth month after implementation] returned to the historical relationship to national levels, being about $0.05 per gallon lower.'' So, OMB has concluded that consumer milk prices are lower in New England than the rest of the nation. I would like to repeat that-- consumer prices in New England with the Compact are lower than national levels. I would encourage a study to check out that relationship now--I am very confident that prices in New England are still lower than the rest of the nation. The Connecticut Agriculture Commissioner Shirley Ferris reports, ``In June of 1997, the month before the Compact took effect, the average retail price for a gallon of whole milk was $2.72. This June, almost a year after the Compact took effect, the price for a gallon of whole milk is only $2.73. And the price of a gallon of 1% milk is even less expensive now than before the Compact--$.03 less per gallon than last June.'' Consumer milk prices, as economists had predicted, are lower in the Compact region than the average for the nation. Another interesting assertion--that milk consumption has dropped in the compact region--was made on the Senate floor recently. This is most odd since national data shows that the rate of milk consumption has dropped more in the rest of the nation than in the Compact region. According to the most recent A.C. Neilson Corporation marketing research data, U.S. gallon sales of fluid milk are down 1.8 percent compared to one year ago. New England gallon sales of fluid milk, however, have decreased by only 0.7 percent. National sales of fluid milk have declined 1.1 percent more than New England sales of fluid milk. In another assertion it was said that ``The only real winners have been the largest industrial dairies of the Upper Northeast.'' First of all, I am not certain if the use of Upper refers to Maine. Second, I am not certain what the ``largest industrial dairies'' means since our plants are so small compared to the Upper Midwest. And third, under the Compact, and as confirmed by the OMB study, it is the producers of milk, the farmers, who get the increase in income under the Compact. If anyone doubts that the dairy farmers in New England did not get increased pay checks someone should randomly call them on the phone and see if they really got the checks. I certainly have not heard complaints that the paychecks were lost in the mails. My distinguished Colleague also said that the Compact puts ``traditional dairy farms'' outside the region ``at a competitive disadvantage.'' OMB reports just the opposite. But again, you do not need an OMB report. Simply pick up the phone and call some dairy producers who live near the Compact region. They are selling milk into the region to take advantage of the Compact. If Wisconsin or Minnesota switched places with New York State, farmers in Wisconsin and Minnesota would do the same--sell into the Compact region to make more income. While I do not know for sure, I suspect that dairy producers in Wisconsin and Minnesota would like more income for all their hard labor. Vermont dairy farmers and neighboring New York dairy farmers sure do. OMB reports there has been ``an increase in milk shipments into New England equal to 8 percent.'' This is not surprising since neighboring producers get higher prices for their milk in the compact region. Except for this benefit for neighboring farmers living just outside the Compact region, OMB reported that ``New England has little effect on dairy markets outside its region, or on national prices or trends. . . . Its shipments outside the region in the form of cheese or milk are small.'' Opponents of the Compact have constantly repeated that it would be a ``trade barrier'' on sales into New England. I could point to many statements to this effect on the floor. I predicted before the Compact was implemented, on the other hand, that since the law required that anyone could sell into the region and since the law required that these sellers get the benefit of the Compact, that there would be increased sales into the region. I was correct--and the evidence reported by OMB shows that neighboring farmers get the benefit of the higher Compact price and thus there has been an increase of sales into the region of 8 percent. This Compact has thus increased trade. Something that increases trade is not usually called a trade barrier. As an interesting footnote OMB reports that the Compact commission decided to provide additional money for New England WIC programs so that more eligible infants, children and pregnant women would be able to participate than would have participated without the Compact. The OMB report states that the ``Compact could support a small increase in participation during the demonstration period.'' The Commission has recently decided to provide additional funding to the school lunch programs. I also want to address the surplus production issue. As background, note that if New England regional milk production decreases less--or increases more--than the national rate, the farm bill requires that the Commission reimburse the federal government for the cost of Commodity Credit Corporation purchases of any ``surplus production'' that might occur. This year the Commission will pay a reimbursement as determined by the Secretary. Very favorable conditions in New England and low feedgrain prices and very unfavorable weather conditions throughout much of the rest of the country created this shift even though there was decrease--2,000 fewer--in cows milked from April to June 1998. As these relatively very unfavorable weather conditions in the rest of the country subside I expect that New England's rate of production will once again grow at a lower rate than the rest of the country-- especially with the drop in cows milked in New England. Also note that almost all of the CCC purchases were of milk product from other regions of the country. To provide some perspective, I also wanted to mention that OMB reports that in 1996, ``New England accounted for 2.93 percent of the Nation's milk production and 2.9 percent of its milk cows.'' As the OMB report shows if other states had a dairy compact, farmers in those states could receive a significant increase in income. So why are some supporting billions' worth of increases in payments to farmers producing nondairy commodities but are opposed to increases in farm income to dairy farmers? The answer is easy. Sir Walter Scott knew many years ago that: ``Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive.'' Corporate opponents of the Compact have tried to argue that this was a fight between consumers and farmers. The OMB study proves that consumer prices are lower in New England than the average for the rest of the country. So that is a false argument. The fight is actually between large manufacturers of milk products-- large multinational corporations--and farmers. Manufacturers of any product, not just manufacturers of cheese or ice cream, want to buy their inputs as cheaply as possible. How do we know that? As with the answers to many questions all you have to do is follow the money. Who is buying ads and time to distort the truth? Who is staffing up to fight the Compact? And who mostly wants the Compact defeated? It certainly isn't farmers in areas that border the Compact region. They take advantage of the Compact's open invitation to trade--and make more money selling into the Compact region. It certainly isn't consumers since they get lower prices than the average for the rest of the nation. It certainly isn't farmers living in the region since they have gotten a significant boost in farm income. To find out the answer one just has to look at lobbying reports that have to be filed in Washington. Who funded efforts and hired people to oppose the Compact? Groups representing the large manufacturers of milk products--that's who. The International Dairy Food Association for example. Their members, like any manufacturers, want to buy their inputs at low cost. One of their members, Kraft, which is owned by a large tobacco company, wants to pass a bill that will allow them to buy milk at less than the price set by milk marketing orders through something called forward contracting. This could greatly increase their profits. They also oppose the dairy compact. The Compact has producers selling milk at more than the level set by milk marketing orders. Under the Dairy Compact, producers receive an over-order premium which means that they get more money than the minimum set by the order, not less. So why was there ever a concern about consumer prices increasing in the Compact region? Prices should have never increased. The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times discussed this in news articles about retail store price gouging. GAO raised the issue in 1991 and is looking at it now. We do know that retail prices for milk are often over double what farmers get for their milk--nationwide. Think about that. Lets look at the time period just before the compact took effect--and pick Vermont as the sample state. As the Wall Street Journal pointed out, in ``Are Grocers Getting Fat by Overcharging for Milk?,'' beginning in November, 1996, the price that farmers got for their milk dropped by almost 25 percent--35 cents or so per gallon. Store prices stayed high which locked in a huge benefit to stores selling to consumers. 35 cents a gallon is a significant increase in benefits to retail stores. Comparing November 1996, to June 1997, the price farmers got for their milk dropped 35 cents a gallon, and stayed low, but the prices stores charged for milk stayed about the same. I have always contended that Dairy Compacts can help reduce this retail store price inflation by stabilizing the price that farmers get for milk--thus reducing the need for stores to build in a safety cushion to protect themselves in case it costs more for them to purchase milk. Without a compact, the price farmers get for their milk can vary significantly. These variations in price are passed through to stores by co-ops and other handlers. Yet stores prefer not to constantly change prices for customers so they build in a cushion. But this huge profit margin can be reduced by Compacts which means that Dairy Compacts will save consumers money and provide more income to farmers. Unfortunately, the OMB study is based on very limited information from USDA. USDA only gave OMB price information from 6 stores in New England--and only in two cities where it was announced in press accounts, in advance, that retail prices would go up even though store and wholesaler costs had dropped 35 cents per gallon. Even in light of this OMB concluded that after 6 months, retail store prices in the compact region of New England were 5 cents lower than the rest of the nation. New England newspaper accounts of the implementation of the Compact were very interesting. For example, the July 1, 1997, the Portland Press Herald, Portland, Maine, points out that ``Cumberland Farms increased the price of whole milk by four cents but dropped the price of skim by a penny'' when the Compact was implemented. Also, they note that ``At Hannaford's Augusta store, Hood milk--a brand-name product--was selling for $2.63 a gallon, while the Hannaford store brand was selling for $2.32.'' Also, ``Shaw's increased its price by about 20 cents a gallon in [parts of] the five other New England states but kept the price the same here [in Maine].'' The June 26, 1997, Boston Globe and the June 27, Providence Journal pointed out before the Compact was implemented that one of the chains signaled a price increase. A spokesman for Shaw's Supermarkets, Bernard Rogan, is quoted as saying that milk prices will go up next week The June 30, Boston Globe reported that ``The region's major supermarkets are raising their milk prices 20 cents a gallon, ignoring arguments that their profit margins are big enough to absorb a new price subsidy for New England dairy farmers that takes effect this week.'' As OMB discovered, after six months this initial signaled increase, described above, was being subjected to competitive pressures and that consumer prices in New England were on average lower than the rest of the nation. Studies of prices charged in stores in Vermont, for example, show that the most important factor in the price of milk is the brand and the store. In cities and towns in Vermont the variation in price among stores was in the 50 cents to one dollar range. In other words, in the same town the price of a gallon of milk varied greatly and still does. These store variations, and variations through the use of store coupons, dwarf any possible impact of the compact. Also note that reports have indicated that the dairy case is the most profitable part of a supermarket. The product profitability of fluid milk is $16.46 per square foot, whereas regular grocery items return only $2.32 per square foot. This information is from testimony of Professor Andrew Novakovic, on April 10, 1991, before the Committee on Agriculture of the U.S. House of Representatives. All other food expenditures dwarf how much income that consumers spend on fluid milk. The savings consumers can achieve through buying ``on sale'' or house-brand items, or through using discount coupons, far exceed typical changes in the price of fluid milk. Only 3 percent of the average household's total expenditures on food go for fluid milk. This information is from an article called ``Food Cost Review,'' 1995, from the Economic Research Service of U.S.D.A. Note also that OMB reported that the Northeast has the Nation's second highest cost of dairy production and its milk generated the lowest returns per cwt after expenses. OMB found that a smaller proportion of New England farms are competitive than in other regions. Net average returns per cow in Vermont are $350 per year and in Wisconsin are $460 year. OMB determined that the Compact generated about $70 more in annual income per cow. So why all the fuss about the compact and who is generating it? For one, Kraft, the international milk manufacturing giant, opposes the compact. Kraft's annual U.S. sales exceed $16 billion. They are owned by Phillip Morris, the tobacco giant. Perhaps the writer Ben Johnson said it best: ``Whilst that for which all virtue now is sold, And almost every vice--almighty gold.'' IDFA, which receives funding from Kraft which is owned by big tobacco, went on a spending spree. One big staff acquisition was from Public Voice for Food and Health Policy. The very person who led Public Voice's press attack on the Compact was negotiating for a job with the milk manufacturers who opposed the Compact. Lobbying registration forms show the whole sad story. In June 1996, the Senior Vice President for Programs at Public Voice publicly defended his organization from charges that its analysis was influenced by corporate contributions. A Lobby Registration form filed in July 1996 shows that he worked for William Wasserman of M &amp; R Strategic as a ``consultant'' for this lobbying arm of IDFA. This is the major reason I returned the golden carrot award back to Public Voice. It is one thing to have honest disagreements about policy. It is another to be working on getting a job with opponents of the Compact at the same time you are leading the charge for Public Voice against the Compact. The Lobbying Reports tell the story. There is an unseemly web of money and promises between the dairy processors and Public Voice. For example, we know that during a critical time period between January 1995 and June 1996, Public Voice accepted $41,000 from the International Dairy Foods Association . We do not know how much IDFA has contributed to Public Voice after June 1996 or how much any of IDFA's corporate members and officers of those corporations have individually contributed to Public Voice. We do not know how much big tobacco gives to Public Voice. I have always expected that it is a huge number considering the large salaries IDFA pays to its top officers. For a six-month period in 1996, IDFA paid at least $30,000 to M &amp; R Strategic Services for its lobbying efforts. These are all public facts documented by lobbying disclosure forms or derived directly from quotes from Public Voice officials. This overwhelming and unseemly evidence compelled me to conclude that, for Public Voice, when it comes to the Dairy Compact, contributions come first, and analysis comes second. The New York Times and other editorial pages have relied upon the numbers provided by Public Voice to substantiate their editorials against the Compact, but we now know those numbers were cooked, and flat-out wrong. I challenged Public Voice to release the names of any dairy-related or tobacco-related contributors and how much they contributed during the last three years. They have not done so yet. I would be pleased just to know if the amount is $100,000 or $500,000, total, over the last three years. IDFA also made other major acquisitions. They hired the Director of Consumer Affairs at USDA, William Wasserman, who set up a subsidiary called the ``Campaign for Fair Milk Prices'' through M &amp; R Associates. Money can solve a lot of problems. For example, his Lobby Report filed on August 15, 1996, shows his client as IDFA and shows him specifically working on the ``Northeast Dairy Compact.'' His Lobbying Registration form filed on February 13, 1996, shows he worked for IDFA on dairy price supports and marketing orders. A key USDA official who represented USDA at dairy meetings on Capitol Hill was also hired by IDFA. Mr. Charles Shaw is now listed as Senior Economist and Director of IDFA in the book 1997 Washington Representatives. Listed as ``counsel or consultants'' for IDFA are--you guessed it--M &amp; R Strategic Services lobbyists Allen Rosenfeld and William Wasserman in 1997 Washington Representatives. I will explain the importance of this in a minute. Before I begin I want to point out that the battle over the Compact is really a battle between well-off dairy manufacturers and struggling dairy farmers. These huge dairy manufacturers cannot win over the editorial boards of The New York Times or The Washington Post on that basis. But if a group like Public Voice carries their public relations message, casting this as a consumer issue, they have a foot in the door. Public Voice has focused on the price increases which took place just as the Compact was implemented. I mentioned these price signaling newspaper articles earlier. But Public Voice has ignored the conclusion that consumer prices are lower in New England than the average for the nation. I wonder why. I wonder how much money they have received from all the major manufacturers of milk and tobacco companies throughout the country over the last three years? I wonder how much money they have received from IDFA and other groups that represent manufacturers over the last three years? I wonder how many others they will hire to influence public opinion in a way that supports the efforts of huge milk manufacturers against the interest of dairy farmers in New England? I want to make one final point. The New York Times has reported on how important the Compact is for the environment. In an article entitled ``Environmentalists Supporting Higher Milk Price for Farmers'' it was explained that keeping farmers on the land maintains the beauty of New England. A lack of farm income resulting from low dairy prices is cited as the major reason dairy farmers leave farming in New England. Production costs in New England are much higher than in other areas of the nation while the value of the land for nonfarm purposes is often greater than its value as farmland. In many cases I am advised that this is very different as compared to vast areas of the Midwest and Upper Midwest where land is worth very little except for its value as farmland. As the Vermont Economy Newsletter reported in July 1994: One of the consequences of the exit of dairy farmers in New England is that land is released from agriculture. Given the close proximity to population centers and recreational areas in New England, good land is in high demand, and as a result there is often a strong incentive to develop the land. What are the consequences of land being converted from farm to non- farm uses? One consequence is that the rural heritage and aesthetic qualities of the working landscape are lost forever. The impact of this loss would be devastating to Vermont and to much of New England. The tourists from some of America's largest urban centers are drawn to rural New England because of its beauty, its farms and valleys, and picturesque roads. Strip malls and condominiums do not have the same appeal to vacationers. The Vermont Partnership for Economic Progress, noted in its 1993 report, A Plan for a Decade of Progress: Actions for Vermont's Economy, ``There are many issues that will influence the [tourism] industry's future in Vermont . . . [including] our state's ability to preserve its landscape.'' The report went on to list among its primary goals: The priority of these goals show that preserving farmland and a viable agriculture industry are important for the overall economic health of the region from Maine, to rural parts of Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts, to Vermont and New Hampshire. Other consequences of farm losses are equally destructive. The American Farmland Trust has completed cost of community services studies in four New England towns, one in Connecticut and three in Massachusetts. The information is from ``Does Farmland Protection Pay?'' These studies show the cost of providing community services for farmland and developed land. It is true that developed land brings in more tax revenues than farmland, especially when farmland is assessed at its agricultural value, as it is in most New England states. Developed land, however, requires far more in the way of services than the tax revenues it returns to the treasuries of municipalities. For example, residential land in these four New England towns required $1.11 in services for every one dollar in tax revenue generated while the farmland required only $0.34 of services for every one dollar of revenue it generated. This demonstrates the major impact that losing dairy farmland has on rural New England. This information is from ``Does Farmland Protection Pay?'' National Geographic recently detailed the risk of economic death by strip malling otherwise tourist-drawing farmland. New England should be allowed to try to reverse this trend, especially in ways that help neighboring states such as under the Compact. The American Farmland Trust Study pointed out that agricultural land actually enhanced the value of surrounding lands in addition to sustaining important economic uses. Keeping land in agriculture and protecting it from development is vitally important for all of New England, which is one reason all six New England states have funded or authorized purchase of agricultural conservation easement programs to help protect farmland permanently. Other economic uses, from condominiums and second homes for retired or professional people from New York, Boston, or Philadelphia to shopping malls to serve them, are waiting in the wings. The pressure to develop in New England is voracious. A 1993 report from the American Farmland Trust called ``Farming on the Edge'' showed that only 14 of the more than 67 counties in New England, were not significantly influenced by urban areas. In fact, eight New England counties were considered to be farming areas in the greatest danger of being lost to development because of their high productivity and close proximity to urban areas. The Champlain and Hudson River Valleys were considered to be among the top 12 threatened agricultural areas in the entire country according to this ``Farming on the Edge'' study. Dairy farming is New England's number one agricultural industry, and a lack of farm income is a major cause for farmers leaving dairying. This discussion underscores the compelling need for the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact because towns will not only lose their rural character with the loss of farms, but they will suffer economic consequences as well. New England suffer the economic losses of the economic activity from farming, but will spend more in services than they gain in revenue as good farmland gets developed. I need to address one more dairy issue, milk marketing order reform. This bill does give USDA a few more months to study this critical issue. I have been fighting for a fair revision of the milk marketing orders as have other Colleagues. Although dairy farmers across the country have told the Agriculture Department that they prefer Option 1- A, the Department continues to support Option 1-B. It has been made clear that the U.S. Department of Agriculture prefers Option 1-B for fluid milk pricing, even though it has been demonstrated that this system would be disastrous for dairy farmers across the country. Economists for AgriMark estimate that under Option 1-B, dairy farmers' income would drop by $365 million dollars next year--that is a loss of $1 million each and every day of the year. I am told by economists at AgriMark that Option 1-B reduces farm income in almost every area of the country. I am also told that every area of the country, including the Upper Midwest, will have higher farm income under Option 1-A as compared to Option 1-B. At the close of the comment period for milk pricing reform, I was joined by 60 Senators in a letter to USDA supporting Option 1-A. Option 1-A is the only option which is both fair and equitable to farmers while promising to continue providing consumers with reasonably priced fresh, wholesome milk. Mr. President, this year Vermont farmers took a one-two punch from Mother Nature. The unprecedented ice storm this winter that knocked out power across the state, forcing farmers to cull their herds, dump milk and scramble for feed. This summer's flooding hit many of these same farmers just as their crops were starting to produce. Their fields have been saturated with water ever since leaving them without feed going into the winter. Ten out of the fourteen counties in Vermont have been declared National Disaster Areas by the President this year. Because the margins are already so close for many farmers, helping these farmers recover from their feed losses could mean the difference between staying in business or selling out. The Livestock Feed Assistance Program will help Vermont farmers get through the winter and not be overwhelmed by recovery costs. I visited these farms after the ice storm and went back again to some of the same areas after the flooding. What I heard at every farm I visited was very simple: farmers need enough assistance to get them through this season. They do not expect a lot of assistance, but they do expect it to be fast and they expect it to be fair. Unfortunately, disaster assistance programs have not always worked this way. Too often, the criteria and program thresholds developed by the national office do not catch the small, family dairy farms we have in the Northeast. The disasters that hit Vermont this year caused damage much like what you see after a tornado. One farm may have lost half his crop while his neighbor may not have been touched. But the way the disaster programs work now, if the county as a whole did not sustain at least 40 percent damage, none of the farmers hit by the disaster would be eligible for assistance. In addition, these programs often require a farmer to sustain at least 40 or 50 percent damage on his farm. This requirement has prevented many farmers who are barely making it anyway from getting assistance. After the ice storm, many Vermont farmers were tinkering at the edge of losing their farms. I know that Secretary Glickman shares my commitment to preserving the family farm and I look forward to working with him to make sure these disaster programs are flexible enough to help our small, family farms. Let me quote a letter from Edie Connellee and Bill Cartright of Waitsfield, Vermont, ``I hope we all purposefully remember to use this experience as a way to better be a community and especially remember that small acts of kindness, even just a phone call, make a huge difference when someone is hurting in any way.'' I hope this is the approach the Agriculture Department will take when implementing these disaster programs. Finally, Mr. President, let me take a moment to talk about the funding levels for the conservation programs in this year's Agriculture Appropriations bill. When we passed the 1996 Farm Bill one of cornerstones of that package was the mandatory funding for the conservation programs. We set aside $200 million a year for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program. Unfortunately, it was all too tempting for the appropriators to cap that program this year at $175 million and use the savings elsewhere. In a year where we have seen state legislation regulating agriculture waste on farms and new regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency, this program is all the more critical to making sure farmers can comply with these requirements. Having worked with dairy farmers across Vermont, but especially around Lake Champlain and Lake Memphremagog, I know how committed they are to protecting our watersheds from farm run-off. Vermont farmers lead the country in developing innovative techniques to control agriculture waste. But they cannot do it alone. The EQIP cost-share payments help them do the right thing without putting them in a financial bind. Now is not the time to be slowing down such a successful program.|105502|981006|30|Scr06oc98-151 1.txt|833|1516|S11545-S11562|41332|6972|VT|Patrick Leahy|S|NA|Democratic

10519980086759|Mr. President, Tuesday, October 6, 1998, will always hold a spot dear to my heart. I hope that today will also be dear to the hearts of the Cheyenne and Arapaho people, dear to Coloradans, and dear to Americans everywhere. Today, S. 1695, the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site Study Act of 1998, a bill I was proud to introduce, was signed into law at a special White House ceremony. Under this new law, our nation takes a major step toward honoring the memory of the many innocent Cheyenne and Arapahoe people massacred there by instructing the National Park Service to locate the site of the Sand Creek Massacre once and for all. Somewhere along the banks of Sand Creek in Southeastern Colorado is a killing field where many innocent Cheyenne and Arapaho, many of my ancestors, fell on the cold morning of November 29, 1864. On that day, in the month known by the Cheyenne and Arapaho people as the Month of the Freezing Moon, this ground was sanctified when the blood of hundreds of innocent Cheyenne and Arapaho women, children and elderly noncombatants was needlessly and brutally spilt. Once this sacred ground is located, I hope it will be acquired and preserved with honor and dignity and in a way that takes into account the concerns of the Cheyenne and Arapaho decedents of those who died there. This ground should also be open to all people as a reminder of the national tragedy that occurred at Sand Creek. On this special day, I would like to take a moment to thank a few people who helped S. 1695 become law. I want to thank my colleague from Colorado, Congressman Bob Schaffer, who introduced the companion bill and shepherded this legislation through the House of Representatives. I also want to thank Senator Craig Thomas, who as the Chairman of the National Parks Subcommittee, was gracious and helpful in getting this bill through the Senate. I especially want to thank my friends William Walksalong, Steve Brady and Laird Cometsevah, who all spoke with such eloquence as witnesses during the March 24th, 1998, hearing on S. 1695, that many in the room, including myself, were deeply moved. I also want to thank LaForce Lonebear who sent in his testimony even though he could not attend the hearing. Finally, I want to thank David Halaas of the Colorado State Historical Society and Roger Walke of the Congressional Research Service for their dedication along the way. Many of these and other friends joined me at the White House earlier today as S. 1695 was signed into law. Finally, on this occasion I want to pay a long overdue tribute to one young Coloradan, Captain Silas S. Soule, whose actions over one hundred and thirty years ago saved many innocent Cheyenne and Arapaho lives on that fateful day at Sand Creek. When Captain Soule, who was under Colonel Chivington's command, heard of Chivington's plan to attack a peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho winter encampment at Sand Creek, he vigorously tried to persuade Chivington to abandon the plan. However, Colonel Chivington, who was known to say ``Nits make Lice'' as a justification for killing innocent Cheyenne and Arapaho women and children, could not be dissuaded. When Chivington ordered his men to attack the peaceful Sand Creek encampment, the vast majority of which were women, children, and elderly noncombatants, Captain Soule steadfastly refused to order his Company to open fire. Captain Soule's refusal allowed many, perhaps hundreds, of innocent Cheyenne and Arapaho to flee the bloody killing field through his Company's line. While the Sand Creek Massacre was at first hailed as a great victory, Captain Soule was determined to make the horrific truth of the massacre known. Even though he was jailed, intimidated, threatened, and even shot at, Soule refused to compromise himself and made his voice heard through reports that reached all the way from Colorado to Washington, and even to the floor of the U.S. Senate. Even with the bloody carnage of the Civil War, the brutal atrocities at Sand Creek shocked the nation. During hearings in Denver, Captain Soule's integrity and unwavering testimony turned the tide against the once popular Chivington and the other men who participated in the massacre and mutilations at Sand Creek. Captain Soule fully realized that telling the truth about the massacre could cost him his life, even telling a good friend that he fully expected to be killed for his testimony. He was right. Walking home with his new bride a short time later, Silas Soule was ambushed and shot in the head by an assassin who had participated in the Sand Creek Massacre. Silas Soule's funeral, held just a few weeks after his wedding, was one of the most attended in Denver up until that time. While Captain Silas Soule's name has largely faded into history, he stands out as one of the few bright rays of light in the moral darkness that surrounds the Sand Creek Massacre. He should be remembered. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.|105091|981006|1|Scr06oc98-165 1.txt|16|92|S11580|4959|844|CO|Ben Campbell|S|NA|Republican

10519980089102|Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Department of Veterans Affairs Hospital and Regional Office Center of White River Junction, Vermont. October 16 marks this facility's sixtieth anniversary. For six decades it has provided compassionate, high-quality service to Vermont and New Hampshire Veterans. On October 16, 1938, an elaborate dedication ceremony was held in White River Junction at the newly completed VA hospital. The next day, the first patient was admitted. In an unusual move, the regional VA office relocated its offices from Burlington to the White River Junction location to better serve veterans in processing their claims for benefits. The facility gradually grew over the years. By the end of World War II, 26 ``Quonset'' huts had to be erected to provide space for the rapidly expanding veterans programs, increasing the hospital's capacity to 250 beds. In 1946, the VA hospital entered into an agreement with Dartmouth Medical School to become a teaching hospital, an arrangement that continues and thrives today. Recognizing the importance of research programs, in 1954, the VA, in partnership with Dartmouth Medical School, launched a medical research initiative. The research function was significantly expanded in 1992 with the completion of a research and education facility that enabled the hospital to perform medical and health services research, rehabilitation and cooperative studies. In addition to these critical fields of study, this facility is helping veterans make more informed choices about their medical treatment through cutting edge outcomes research. From 1971 through 1981, several construction projects were undertaken to modernize and expand the hospital. In 1989, the VA began its venture of providing community-based outreach centers to meet veterans' primary care needs in locations closer to their homes. A outreach clinic was opened in Burlington, and based on the success of this project, a community clinic was opened in Bennington earlier this year. The White River Junction VA center has also done an exemplary job of meeting more than just the veterans' health care needs. Vermont veterans are also very fortunate to have, under the same roof, a very capable group of people to assist them with their benefit needs. The staff is small but mighty when its comes to their advocacy for veterans and I greatly appreciate the assistance they have provided Vermont veterans, for more than half a century, as well as to my office for the past 20 years. In closing, Mr. President, I want to publicly thank all of the unsung heroes associated with this tremendous facility. They know who they are--the director of this facility, Gary DeGasta; the dedicated staff at the hospital and regional office; the Veterans Service Organizations who donate so much time and money to help provide for veterans; and, of course, the veterans, who for 60 years have supported the mission of this fine facility with their continuous patronage. To my friends at the VA in White River Junction--Happy Anniversary. May you have many more.|105501|981014|1|Scr14oc98-280 1.txt|16|63|S12593|3078|489|VT|James Jeffords|S|NA|Republican
10519980089385|Mr. President, I have great concerns about our Nation's policy towards Cuba. Castro remains, in the mind of this Senator and the minds of most, as an individual who has brought great harm to that nation, and it persists to this day. The human suffering there is incalculable. Some months ago, I joined with my distinguished friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, who has had considerable experience in this region of our hemisphere, in trying to seek legislation to allow the sale of U.S. food, medicine and medical equipment to Cuba. Regrettably, that has not been done in its totality. There have been some efforts, but nevertheless that continues to present itself as an example of how I believe--and others share my belief--that the overall policy between the United States of America and Cuba should be thoroughly, pragmatically and objectively reviewed. With that purpose in mind, I and other Senators--I think some 15 in number--have written the President of the United States requesting that he, hopefully jointly with the Congress, establish a commission to make such a study. In short, we wrote President Clinton recommending ``the establishment of a national bipartisan commission to review our current U.S.-Cuba policy.'' My reason for making this recommendation is simple and straightforward. The current United States-Cuba policy in effect for nearly 40 years--that is astonishing, 40 years--has yet to achieve its goal of a peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba. Of course, Castro remains the single most formidable obstacle to achieving that goal. Now the time has come, in our judgment, for a thoughtful, rational and objective analysis of our current U.S. policy toward Cuba and its overall effect on this hemisphere. I am not alone in putting forward this proposal. As I have previously stated, I was joined in this recommendation to the President by a distinguished and bipartisan group of Senate colleagues. In addition, a world-respected group of former senior Government officials of our United States have written to me--I asked for that letter and obtained it--in strong support of the establishment of the commission. That distinguished group includes Howard Baker, Jr., former Senate majority leader; Frank Carlucci, former Secretary of Defense; Lawrence Eagleburger, former Secretary State; Henry Kissinger, former Secretary of State; William D. Rogers, former Under Secretary of State; Harry W. Shalaudeman, former Assistant Secretary of State and Malcolm Wallop, former U.S. Senator. Further, I am informed that former Secretary of State George Shultz supports our efforts. Mr. President, it is my hope that President Clinton will act to implement our recommendation. Should he choose to do so, the analysis and recommendations that are put forth will provide both the Congress and the Administration with the means to shape and strengthen our future relationship with Cuba. The recommendation that we have for this commission is parallel to one that was set up by a past President in response to the need to look at the overall hemisphere. It was known as the Kissinger Commission. It has, I think, the customary provisions in it whereby the President makes certain appointments and the Congress will make certain appointments. I think there will be a wealth of talent ready, able, and willing to step forward at the call of the Executive branch and the Legislative branch to take up the responsibility of a very serious challenge, to establish a revised policy between our Nation and Cuba. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent my letter to President Clinton, the letter sent to me by Lawrence Eagleburger, and an October 16, 1998, Washington Post editorial on this subject be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:|105515|981020|1|Scr20oc98-148 1.txt|16|241|S12681-S12683|3857|618|VA|John Warner|S|NA|Republican
10619990000841|Mr. Speaker, there are a number of reasons why we need it; and we need it more desperately as each year goes. But I would first say that we have needed to reform the system for many years. One of the things that is very clear is we have had a hard time finding consensus because we each have our own campaign finance reform bill. So one of the first key things to do was to see if we could build consensus amongst different groups. But in terms of why we need it, we need it because, in this democrat system of government, we need to make sure that decisions are being made based on merit and based on what is right for our country and not based on who gave me this campaign contribution or that campaign contribution. When you had the abuses in 1974 centered around Watergate and all that was involved, the majority party made two decisions. One, they were going to hold President Nixon accountable and they were secondly going to reform the system. They did both. I have been hard pressed to know why we did not take the same tack as this new majority. We needed to hold President Clinton accountable, and we needed to reform the system. Our failure to reform the system then calls into question in the minds of some of our constituents, ``Well, you're just doing this to get the President.'' No, we needed to hold the President accountable, but then we needed to reform the system to make sure the decisions, to the best of our ability, are based on merit, not based on the kind of money that was contributed. Now, in 1974 they devised a system, you would limit what a candidate could spend and you would limit what a candidate could raise in terms of individual contributions, and you would have a system where both of them worked. The Supreme Court said it is constitutional to limit your overall individual contributions but you cannot limit what someone spends, so a wealthy person can spend whatever they want, and a wealthy person under the law can spend whatever they want helping a particular candidate as long as they do not work with that candidate. But once they begin to work in tandem with that candidate, then they come under the contribution limitations. Those contributions were $1,000 for an individual and $5,000 for PAC contributions. One of the confessions I would say as I worked on this issue, I thought the real problem were the political action committees because they were, quote-unquote, the ``special interests'' and so I looked to eliminate political action committee money. As I went around the country and around my State arguing on this issue and debating people, I felt I was losing the argument. I began to realize that people had a right to assemble under a political action committee for whatever special interest they want. And then a candidate has the right or not to accept it. But a political action committee contribution is $5,000. That is it. That is the limit. Soft money, which is the unlimited sums contributed by individuals, corporations, labor unions, and other interest groups have made political action committee money look saintly because it is unlimited, and it has brought in such incredible amounts of money that most reasonable people could concur, and concur rightfully, that Members' votes are affected by the large contributions that are given.|106416|990210|1|Hcr10fe99-104 1.txt|16|20|H583|166|29|PA|Curt Weldon|H|7|Republican

10619990009614|Mr. Speaker, after the speech by my colleague, I think it is useful to perhaps tone down the rhetoric and bring some statistics and some information from Dr. John Lott, a distinguished scholar at the Yale University Law School, and talk about experts on crime and what they have to say. Mr. Speaker, I have an article from the Washington Times that is dated April 26 that I will make a part of the Record wherein Dr. Lott highlights a number of cases in his article detailing how anti-gun advocates routinely admit facts, figures, and they change statistics to generally develop a misinterpretation of gun ownership in America. Along with Dr. Lott, a Professor Bill Landes from the University of Chicago has done extensive research on waiting periods, sentencing laws, background checks, and other current gun control laws and they compare those with the effect on deterring so-called ``rampage killings.'' As to their conclusions, Mr. Speaker, I will quote directly from their article: ``While higher arrests and conviction rates, longer prison sentences and the death penalty reduce murders generally, neither these measures nor restrictive gun laws had a discernible impact on mass public shootings. We found only one policy that effectively reduces these attacks: The passage of right-to-carry laws.'' Both these professors confirm that law-abiding citizens, possessing a legal right to carry concealed hand guns, had a dramatic impact on multiple victim shootings. Indeed, these laws, on average, decreased multiple-victim shootings by one-fifth. Now, in my home State of Florida, they recognized this fact. In 1987, they passed a law to allow law-abiding citizens to carry a licensed, concealed weapon. What were the results? Florida's homicide rate dropped from 37 percent above the national average to 3 percent below the national average. The decrease in violent offenses involving firearms in Florida continues to decline. Now, according to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement Uniform Crime Report, in 1989, firearms accounted for 30 percent of all violent offenses. Last year, firearms only accounted for 20 percent of all violent offenses. Mr. Speaker, 31 States today now have right-to-carry laws and have experienced similar results like Florida. Dr. Lott's article further highlights the need for individual Americans to be able to defend themselves outside their home. To address this issue, I developed and introduced legislation, H.R. 492, which is identical to my bill in the 105th Congress which was debated in the House Committee on the Judiciary. My bill establishes a national standard providing for reciprocity in regard to the manner in which nonresidents of a State may carry certain concealed firearms into the State. Now, in order to carry a concealed firearm across State lines, a person would have to be properly licensed for carrying a concealed weapon in his home State and would have to obey the concealed weapon laws of that State they are entering. If the State they are entering does not have a concealed weapons law, the national standard provision in this legislation would dictate the rules in which a concealed weapon would have to be maintained. For instance, the national standard would disallow the carrying of a concealed weapon in a school, police station, or a bar serving alcoholic beverages. My bill also exempts qualified former and current law enforcement officers from State laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed handguns. Now, this language was adopted during debate on the juvenile justice bill last year. Mr. Speaker, right-to-carry laws are an effective deterrent to these mass killings and random murders. States which have adopted such laws, on the average, have 24 percent less violent crime, 19 percent less homicides, and 39 percent less robberies. These are precisely the type of statistics which gun control supporters refuse to acknowledge. Yesterday, the President stated that he is ``subdued, frustrated, and very saddened'' as he reflected on the lack of pending gun control legislation in Congress. Mr. President, we, too, are frustrated, frustrated that those who seek to curb gun violence refuse to acknowledge the one effective deterrent, the right to carry. So, as I stated earlier, the right-to-carry defense should not be confined to State boundaries. A law-abiding citizen legally carrying a concealed firearm in his or her State should be entitled to the same protection in any State. I urge my colleagues to support my bill.|106418|990429|109|Hcr29ap99-81 1.txt|7230|7671|H2476-H2516|181|34|PA|Bud Shuster|H|9|Republican
10619990009909|Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to one of our Nation's most valuable resources, the dedicated men and women who serve as teachers. I know that dedication, because I have been married for 30 years to a high school algebra teacher. I come home at night in our district at 9:30 or 10:00 and exhausted, and she is still grading papers or inputting grades into the computer. Our teachers are hard-working professionals who are on the front lines of our struggle to provide a quality education for every child in America. Day in and day out they work hard so that our children can be prepared for whatever they want to be in the future. Teacher appreciation week is our time to show the appreciation for teachers. I would like to say that we could do much better. We should be able to put aside our differences and pass worthwhile legislation like H.R. 1196, which would repeal the 60-month limit on student loan interest deductibility and help relieve the burden of student loan debt for our teachers; H.R. 4555, the Teacher Technology Training Act, so that local money could be provided to train teachers in computer-related skills in the classroom; the School Construction Act to modernize our school facilities; and H.R. 1623, the Classroom Size Reduction and Teacher Quality Act. Mr. Speaker, there are lots of things we can do outside of just recognizing our teachers this week.|106309|990504|3|Hcr04my99-129 1.txt|37|67|H2594-H2598|1759|287|NJ|Bob Franks|H|7|Republican

They requested $130 million in the budget. Only $22 million of that is for patent examiners, where they say the shortage is. The other increases they are asking for are really a lot of bells and whistles. I have to point out, they are preparing to build an enormous marble building down the river to consolidate all of their offices in one place. I do not know of an agency of the Government that is going to have a finer place to work, and that is fine.

10619990038186|Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues in both Chambers to press forward in getting to the truth in airing the facts behind the administration's deal with Moscow. I ask my colleagues that sit on the relevant committees to investigate the administration and, of course, the Vice President's role in co-chairing the 1995 meeting with the Russian Prime Minister on the U.S.-Russian Binational Commission. My colleagues, it is only through newspaper articles recently that we have hints of the administration's turning a blind eye concerning Moscow's arms sales to Iran. The White House has refused to provide a copy of the classified 1995 ``aide-memoire'' signed by Vice President Gore and Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin that stated the United States would not impose penalties on Moscow as required by U.S. law. The aide-memoire reveals an implicit agreement to ignore U.S. laws governing the U.S. response to arms sales to terrorist nations, including Iran. Mr. Speaker, the law I am referring to is the Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act that was passed in 1992, which requires sanctions against countries that sell advanced weaponry to countries the State Department classifies as state sponsors of terrorism. It is interesting that then-Senator Gore, along with Senator McCain, authored this law, also known as the Gore-McCain Act. The law is rooted in concerns about Russian sales to Iraq of some of the most sophisticated weapons that the Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement explicitly allowed. In 1995, an agreement signed by Vice President Gore and Russia's Prime Minister Chernomyrdin endorsed Russia's completion of sophisticated and advanced arms deliveries to Iran. The Vice President and the Russian Prime Minister mentioned an arms agreement in general terms at a news conference the day the agreement was signed, but the details have never been disclosed to Congress or the public. The weapons Russia has committed to supply to Iran include one kilo- classed diesel-powered submarine, 160 T-72 tanks, 600 armored personnel carriers, numerous anti-ship mines, cluster bombs, and a variety of long-range guided torpedoes and other munitions for the submarine and tanks. Russia agreed to complete the sales by the end of 1999, and not to sell weapons to Iran other than the ones specified. Russia has already provided Iran with fighter aircraft and surface-to-air missiles. The kilo-class submarine sold to Iran should be of particular concern to Congress and the American public because it can be hard to detect and could pose a threat to oil tankers or American war ships in the Gulf. Additionally, Mr. Speaker, Russia continues to be a significant supplier of conventional arms to Iran despite the Gore-Chernomyrdin deal, the Central Intelligence Agency reported in August. Those working for the Vice President argue that the arms pact aided the U.S. because the submarine and tanks were not advanced weapons, as defined by the Pentagon; and, thus, the U.S. could not have applied sanctions anyway. However, statements by the White House and the Vice President's office defending the policy of not sanctioning Russia was contradicted by a letter sent to Russia in January by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. The letter to Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov states that the United States would have imposed sanctions on Russia for its arms sales if there had been no 1995 agreement. ``Without the aide-memoire, Russia's conventional arms sales to Iran would have been subject to sanctions based on various provisions of our laws.'' Furthermore, Senator McCain, one of the principal authors of the act said, ``Clearly, the 1995 Gore-Chernomyrdin agreement was intended to evade sanctions imposed by the legislation written in 1992 by the Vice President and me.'' Furthermore, he went on to say, ``If the administration acquiesced in the sale, then they have violated both the intent and the letter of the law.'' Without the explicit act of Congress, the Vice President did not have the power or authority to commit the United States to ignore U.S. law. The Vice President's deal with Moscow gives the Russians not only the green light to violate our Nation's laws but encourages them to do so. The administration has already admitted that Russia has failed to meet its promise to end deliveries by December 1999 to Iran. So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in both Chambers to properly investigate, find the truth, and I should say get to the bottom of our relationships with Russia.|106194|991020|1|Hcr20oc99-45 1.txt|18|33|H10373|958|176|KS|Todd Tiahrt|H|4|Republican
10619990039032|Mr. Speaker, I will accept that from the gentleman. I will say the controlling owners. We do have a minority holder out there who thinks for pricing and negotiation purposes. The fact is that the controlling owners think it is a great proposal. The end holders think it is a great proposal; they support it. The people of the valley think it is a great proposal. The gentleman brought up three county commissioners in a very small county. I have gone to them. They were worried about their $68,000 loss of property tax. I replaced it with $80-some-thousand, and it has an inflationary type of clause in it. It is not exactly stuck with inflation, but it goes up, that we will increase that amount every year. We have done everything we can to appease those people, but what I think is the most important as I speak to the gentleman from Colorado is this process that we are talking about. I agree with the gentleman on Steamtown. I agree with the gentleman on some of these other issues, but I think everybody with a couple of exceptions who has taken a look at this, the Sand Dunes say, gosh, this ought to be preserved for all future of America. We ought to expand on this and make it a national park. The fact that we have it on here on the House floor is exactly where it ought to be. The best point I think the gentleman has made this evening is, Mr. McInnis, just because it is in your congressional district does not mean we should vote for it; that is right. That is why 435 Members of the United States Congress should vote for it, not one person in one committee stop it from ever having a hearing. Mr. Speaker, just the same as we should not pass it just because of the fact it is in my district, we should also not allow it to have a committee hearing because of one person. We should bring it to the whole body, and that is exactly what we have done this evening. I encourage all of my 434 colleagues to vote yes on this and create a national park for the future of America. I am proud of it. People in Colorado are proud of it. We want to show it off, not just to America, but to the world. Mr. Speaker, I am submitting a letter from the State of Colorado raising an issue regarding control and management of hunting in the Great Sand Dunes National Preserve. I share the State of Colorado's concern, and as the House author of this bill and one involved in the negotiations that produced the final Senate version, I would read the current language in the light most favorable to Colorado's sovereignty and predominant role in hunting, fishing and trapping that states have in our federal/state system. Specifically, the term ``limited periods'' in section 7 of the bill, referring to the time periods that hunting, fishing or trapping in the preserve may be prohibited, should be strictly construed to limit the time and nature of the closures or restrictions on hunting, fishing and trapping in the Great Sand Dunes National Preserve. Permanent closures or expansive closures would absolutely run counter to the intent of this legislation. Moreover, section 7 of the legislation calls for consultation by the Park Service with the appropriate Colorado agency on any limited prohibitions of hunting, fishing and trapping. As an author of this legislation, this language should be read as expansively as possible to require real, meaningful consultation with the State of Colorado, including involvement in the decisions and crafting the scope and nature of any closures to allow for the maximum management of the bighorn sheep herds and other wildlife in the Great Sand Dunes Preserve.|106021|991025|11|Hcr25oc99-91 1.txt|702|772|H10755-H10761|4441|836|AR|Marion Berry|H|1|Democratic

We know that a U.S. postal worker can be shot and killed simply because he happens to be a Filipino American. We see people targeted for specific crimes. I authored the original hate crimes legislation in 1993. It had two loopholes: It excluded sex and sexual orientation.

10619990064971|Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to simplify the taxation of life insurance companies under the Internal Revenue Code. This bill repeals two sections of the Code that no longer serve valid tax policy goals, section 809 and section 815. Section 809, which was enacted in 1984 as part of an overhaul of the taxation of life insurance companies, disallows a deduction for some of the dividends that mutual life insurance companies pay to their policyholders. It was enacted at a time when mutual life insurance companies were thought to be the dominant segment of the industry and was intended to ensure that stock life insurance companies were not competitively disadvantaged. Since that time, however, the number of mutual life insurance companies has dwindled while the number of stock life insurance companies has grown and the industry estimates that mutual life insurance companies will constitute less than ten percent of the industry within a few years. The section 809 tax has not been a significant component of the taxes paid by life insurance companies but it has been burdensome because of its unpredictable nature and complexity. Moreover, the original reason for its enactment no longer exists. Therefore, the bill would repeal section 809. Section 815 was enacted in 1959 along with other changes to the taxation of life insurance companies. The 1959 changes permitted life insurance companies to defer tax on one-half of their underwriting income so long as such income was not distributed to their shareholders. The tax deferred income was accounted for through ``policyholder surplus accounts.'' In 1984, Congress revised the taxation of mutual and stock life insurance companies and as part of these revisions, stock life insurance companies were no longer permitted to defer tax on one half of their underwriting income or add to their policyholder surplus accounts. At the same time, Congress did not eliminate the existing policyholder surplus accounts or trigger tax on the accrued amounts but instead left them in place. Thus, the amounts in those accounts remain subject to tax only when a triggering event occurs . Since 1984, little revenue has been collected under this provision as companies avoid triggering events. The Administration recently has proposed taxing the amounts in the accounts, creating uncertainty for companies with these accounts. Finally, only life insurance companies that were in existence in 1984 even have these accounts. The bill would repeal this provision. Elimination of these complicated and outmoded provisions will provide greater certainty to the taxation of these companies and allow them to restructure their businesses to compete in the developing global financial services marketplace. While this bill is only a modest attempt to simplify the taxation of one sector of our economy, it represents a first step towards overall simplification of our Internal Revenue Code. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: S. 2875.

10619990068378|Mr. President, I rise to introduce a new legislative proposal to help level the playing field for small businesses that try to provide health insurance for their employees and make health insurance more affordable for all Americans. While our economy is the strongest it's ever been, the number of uninsured Americans has gone from 32 million in 1987 to more than 44 million today. And that number is rising. While our nation continues to forge ahead in improving the world's greatest health care system, we face the increasing problem of having a significant percentage of our population that has no way to access it. One of the largest sectors of the uninsured is employees who work for small businesses. While small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy, they also face some of the greatest challenges--particularly when it comes to providing health benefits for their employees. While the number of uninsured among employees who work for companies with more than 500 people is 1 in 8, that number soars among companies with fewer than 25 employees--to 1 in 3. This is because large employers can spread the costs of providing health insurance among their multitude of employees, while smaller companies have a much more difficult task. We need to help small business owners--and the employees who work for them--better afford quality health insurance. Today, I propose that we lend a hand to the hardworking small businessmen and women of America, and their employees, to help them erase the gap in coverage between large and small businesses. The legislation I am introducing--the Health Insurance Equity Act--will give small businesses with less than 50 employees a 20% tax credit toward the cost of buying health insurance for their employees. To encourage small businesses to pool together and take advantage of the same benefits that their larger counterparts have, the credit will increase to 25% if the businesses join new ``qualified health benefit purchasing coalitions'' that can help them easily administer their new health plans and negotiate better rates with insurers. In addition, this legislation makes a change in the tax code to ensure that these new coalitions can enjoy the full benefit of charitable contributions from private foundations. While some private foundations have indicated that they are willing to help fund some of the start-up costs of health purchasing coalitions, current law does not specify that these sorts of contributions would qualify as a charitable donation. For this reason, private foundations have been reluctant to make grants or loans to these coalitions. The bill I am introducing today will clarify that aid to qualified health benefit purchasing coalitions are entirely tax-deductible, which can help encourage private foundations and other interested parties to help the coalitions with their important duties. By helping people get better access to basic health insurance--before they get very sick--we can save money for both hospital and patient, while helping millions of Americans live more healthy lifestyles. With that Mr. President, I send my legislation to the desk, and ask that it be appropriately referred. I also ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record. I yield the floor. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: ``Sec. 45D. Employee health insurance expenses.'' ``Sec. 9841. Qualified health benefit purchasing coalition. ``Subchapter D. Qualified health benefit purchasing coalition.''. S. 2995. A bill to assist States with land use planning in order to promote improved quality of life, regionalism, sustainable economic development, and environmental stewardship, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak of an issue which effects every American, and future generations of Americans. As the saying goes, ``burn me once, shame on you, burn me twice, shame on me.'' After the second World War, waves of returning GIs--looking for a better life for themselves and their families--helped create a unprecedented building boom in the United States. The potato fields of Long Island were turned into massive tracts of uniform new houses known as Levittown. This same post-World War II growth at one point so overwhelmed my own home town of Warwick, Rhode Island that the state newspaper described the city as ``a suburban nightmare''. Before long, strip retail development catering to the automobile became the trademark of the American landscape. Our landscape has since been pockmarked by incremental, haphazard development, which too often offends the eye, and saps our economic strength by requiring very expensive investment for extending infrastructure farther and father into the country side. Driving down the street in Anytown USA you see an apartment house next to a fast food franchise, next to a fire station, next to an office building, next to a strip mall. That isn't planned development. Over forty years after Levittown, we find ourselves in a strong economy sustained as never before. At the same time, every state in the country face significant problems relating to unplanned growth, from protecting open space in the east to protecting precious drinking water supplies in the west. We ought to seize the moment and learn from our previous mistakes--we should not be burned twice. The last thing anyone needs, citizens and developers alike, is to have angry and divisive planning board, zoning board or city or town council meetings. The best thing we can do to ensure wise growth is to encourage decision makers to work together with the citizens, developers, interest groups and others to develop a consensus for planning for growth in an orderly manner. That is what the Community Character Act does. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senators Bennett, Cleland, Jeffords, Levin, Lieberman and Leahy to introduce a bill that I believe will help states plan wise growth. This bill, Community Character Act of 2000, seeks to authorize $25 million over four years for a grant program to help states develop or update their land use statutes and Comprehensive Plans. No state in the nation is immune from the effects of rapid unplanned development. Suburbanization is expensive, costing state and local taxpayers dearly for extending roads and infrastructure, and building new schools. Even states considered more rural are now facing rapid alterations in land use and quality of life. Federal grants under this act would help states promote citizen participation in the developing of state plans, encourage sustainable economic development, coordinate transportation and other infrastructure development, conserve historic scenic resources and the environment, and sustainably manage natural resources. I am pleased that this bill has such bipartisan support and hope that the full Senate will give it favorable action. I thank the chair and ask unanimous consent that my full statement and the text of the bill appear in the Record. There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:|106268|990630|77|Scr30jn99-101 1.txt|1470|1472|S7835-S7852|129|22|MN|Paul Wellstone|S|NA|Democratic

10619990071562|I am sure we will Mr. President, I am in strong opposition to the amendment offered by my friend from Virginia. This amendment, if passed, will put an end to the unprecedented partnership developed between the Federal Government and the State of Florida in an effort to restore and protect America's Everglades. While I am sure my colleague from Virginia has the best of intentions in offering his amendment, I caution my colleagues that one- size-fits-all solutions can be extremely harmful to something as sensitive and as difficult as Everglades restoration. It may be useful to take a few minutes today to help highlight the Everglades provision in the water resources bill before us and explain how the amendment of the Senator from Virginia will impact our longstanding efforts to restore and protect this unique ecosystem. Let me begin by stating that the legislation before us today is a consensus product supported by a full spectrum of environmental groups and economic stakeholders. It is supported by Florida's two Indian tribes, Gov. Jeb Bush of the State of Florida, and it is supported by the Clinton administration. Nine months ago, my colleague from Florida, Senator Graham, and I set out to write a balanced Everglades bill that addressed the needs of south Florida's environment and its citizens. This was no small task. We asked individuals and groups who have long been divided to set aside their differences and work together with us. We asked them to help us restore this vibrant, natural system to its former glory. With the steady leadership of Chairman Bob Smith and Senator Baucus, we have accomplished our goal. The bill we bring to the floor today is something of which all Americans, and I believe all Senators, can be proud. In the bill we are considering today, we authorize a comprehensive plan to undo the harm done by 50 years of Federal efforts to control flooding in south Florida, without consideration for damage done to south Florida's environment. This comprehensive plan was developed over the past 8 years by the Corps of Engineers, with input from economic and environmental stakeholders, local governments, scientists, restoration engineers, the people of south Florida, and the Congress. It is recognized throughout south Florida and the Nation as a fair and balanced plan to provide for the water-related needs of the region while, for the first time, ensuring that the needs of the Everglades will be met as well. It is terribly important that we do this. Without this plan, the Everglades will die and water, the lifeblood of south Florida's economy, will continue to be siphoned off into the sea without benefiting the environment or the people who live and work in the region. Let me take a moment to share with you some of the principles Senator Graham and I have used to guide our efforts this year in drafting this bill. We wanted to be sensitive to the legitimate concerns and needs of all citizens and interests who have a stake in how the plan is implemented, we wanted to be true to the restoration mandate and ensure that the Everglades got the first benefit of any new water generated by the plan, and we wanted to affirm and establish in law the true partnership we share with the State of Florida in achieving the plan's restoration goal. The cooperation between the State agencies charged with managing this effort and the Federal Government over the years has been truly unprecedented. The State shared the cost of developing the plan we are considering today. The Corps of Engineers has benefited greatly from the engineering talent at the South Florida Water Management District. Florida has been our full partner in bearing half of the cost of the restoration projects already underway in the Everglades. The State has committed to split evenly the cost of implementing the plan once it is authorized. The reason for this partnership is simple. Both the State and Federal Government have a vital interest in the restoration of the Everglades. Both the State and the Federal Government should pay for the cost of operating and maintaining the restoration project once it is built. I say this to provide background for the debate on the amendment before us.

10619990080225|Mr. President, I applaud and congratulate the Senator from North Dakota. With this election having taken more than 30 days, and the stock market, as a result of the turmoil of the election, having dropped significantly, there is a lot of uneasiness in the economy. I hope the people who are cloistered in the Federal Reserve, hidden away from public view, have the opportunity to listen to what the Senator from North Dakota said. It is so important the people of the State of Nevada and this country be given a break at the beginning of the year on interest rates. Construction is being hurt. Everything we do is affected by the interest rates which as the Senator so graphically illustrated, dictate our lives. I hope the Federal Reserve would follow what the Senator from North Dakota has said. The Senator from North Dakota has had long experience working on financial matters, including the Ways and Means Committee in the House of Representatives, and in the Senate as head of the Policy Committee, and has given great direction on fiscal matters.

10619990085171|Mr. President, it is my understanding that the tobacco provisions of this bill, will provide an additional $328,000,000 in funds for farmers who produce the major cigarette tobaccos--burley and flue-cured tobacco. It is those farmers who have been the most affected by recent developments with respect to the manufacture and use of cigarettes. It is those farmers also who are the subject of the recent ``Phase II Settlement'' in which moneys are being made available to burley and flue-cured tobacco growers through the use of State trusts. It is also my understanding that the bill's reference to those farms who receive ``quotas'' under the Agriculture Adjustment Act of 1938, is intentional, and does limit the relief, to burley and flue-cured tobacco. The reference to ``quotas'' is to poundage quotas and burley and flue-cured tobacco are the only tobaccos under the current regulatory scheme that receive poundage ``quotas'' as opposed to acreage allotments. This limitation to burley and flue-cured tobaccos is intentional and reflects recent developments.|106204|991012|51|Scr12oc99-110 1.txt|1955|1970|S12405-S12420|1064|165|KY|Mitch McConnell|S|NA|Republican

10620000024515|Mr. Speaker, I support the rule and I support the bill. America is supposed to be family oriented, family friendly. Who is kidding whom here today? America's tax policy penalizes achievement and penalizes marriage. America's tax policy promotes dependency and promotes promiscuity. America's tax policy actually subsidizes illegitimacy. In addition to killing jobs, IRS commissioner after commissioner made the statement, and many Members have quoted it, the Tax Code is used as a behavior modification economic program, and I agree; behavior modification through and by a Tax Code of devious and manipulative machinations that should have no place in our country. If the founders wanted a Tax Code to modify behavior, they would have hired Sigmund Freud to write this thing. Now, as far as what has been done in the last 6 years, there have been some significant reforms. The Republicans have included significant tax reforms, wage attachments have gone from 3.1 million in 1997 to 540,000 in 1999. Property liens have gone from 680,000 under the old plan to 160,000 under the new reformed plan. And listen to this, America: property seizures before the IRS reform bill passed here in this Congress through the leadership of the gentleman from Texas , the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, property seizures in 1997 were 10,037; 10,037 Americans lost their homes, their farms. In 1999, after the reform, 161. Now, how could we make the claim that nothing is happening? I think it is out of hand. The Tax Code is out of control. In fact, I think the IRS is so screwed up, they could not find their posterior from some hole in the ground. Finally, we should throw the income Tax Code out and, yes, tear it up by its roots, with a simple final retail sales tax, with the proper exemptions to save, and those people on the bottom end of the ladder and those seniors. Let me close by saying this, and why I support this bill. Congress should promote marriage. Congress should reward marriage. Congress should promote family. Congress should reward family. A Congress that overtaxes married couples does not reward nor promote family nor marriages. I yield back the fact that we have in fact placed in the Tax Code mechanisms that seem to reward all that is wrong and penalize all that is right. I think the American people see it, the American people know it. I am very comfortable voting for the rule. I will vote for this bill.|106390|000712|21|Hcr12jy00-36 1.txt|515|556|H5851-H5856|2436|419|OH|Jim Traficant|H|17|Democratic

10620000026212|Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker, as we all know, we had a very thorough and informed debate in the House just a few months ago on these very issues. The spotlight is now on the Senate. There is a clear majority there for passage of permanent NTR, and I express the hope of many of us that there can be full debate on the Senate side and action there expeditiously, which I think should mean within the next few weeks. I want to dwell on the major challenges ahead, because clearly the U.S.-China economic relationships are at the beginning of a new phase; they are far from their final form. So I believe there is a need to focus on these challenges, and we cannot simply put our economic relationships and our broader relationships with China on automatic pilot. As we know, there were major provisions in the legislation that passed the House that attempt to address these very critical challenges, and we need to focus on their effective implementation. The legislation set up a high-level executive congressional commission to be a continuing watchdog and a creative force in the area of human rights, including worker rights. We need to be sure during this session that that legislation is adequately funded. We need to be sure that the appointees to this vital high-level commission have the interest and the determination to make that commission work, as the Helsinki Commission has worked, and, if I might express the hope, even more so. We need to be sure that this commission gets off to a strong start. I hope whatever the point of view may be in terms of PNTR that all of us will join together on both sides of the aisle and within each caucus and conference to make sure that happens. The legislation also calls for strong monitoring and enforcement of Chinese trade-related commitments and, as the chairman of the committee indicated, there are numerous, indeed essentially innumerable commitments. There also in the legislation is a strong anti-surge mechanism to make sure that there is a safeguard against major loss of American jobs in any specific sector. We need to be sure that the requests for adequate funding that have come on behalf of the Commerce Department and USTR to carry out these critical monitoring enforcement duties are fully funded in the appropriation processes. Those processes are far from complete when it comes to these aspects. We also need to be sure that the ongoing discussions in Geneva, in the working group on China, that in these discussions in Geneva the administration continues to press for a regular annual review within the WTO of these commitments by China. I see that we have been joined by the gentleman from Nebraska , with whom I have had the chance to work on these very provisions, as well as the chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member of the full committee and the chairman of the full committee. I think all of us join in indicating the importance of the implementation process of these provisions. In a word, we need now to focus on the future. We are far closer to the beginning than to the end of the challenges that we face in our economic relationships with China. China, as it grows, is already 1,200,000,000 people and is projected to become the second largest national economy within 20 years. We need to focus on these challenges as China emerges from 50 years as a state-controlled economy and with state abuses of human rights and individual freedoms. So today I urge my colleagues to vote no on this resolution and to join together to continue on this important and difficult road of confronting the challenges ahead. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.|106252|000718|15|Hcr18jy00-67 1.txt|178|239|H6399-H6424|3688|643|MI|Sander Levin|H|12|Democratic

Just last week, Mr. Speaker, back on the back rail, I said to Herb, you will be missed, in response to his announced intention to retire from this body. He said, oh, I will be back. This tells us, Mr. Speaker, how fragile, how indefinite, how uncertain life can be. As has been said by other speakers, Herb's congressional legacy will be formidable and impressive. One of his most salient contributions was his steadfast advocacy for a strong national defense. His district, after all, is home to one of the nerve centers of our defense community. I say to the gentleman from Richmond, Virginia , my friend, I fondly recall an occasion when I delivered the OCS graduation address at the Coast Guard Reserve Training Center in Yorktown, which is in Herb's district. After the ceremony, Herb came to me and said, I so much enjoy coming to this place. It is beautifully located on the banks of the York River, and Herb expressed such pride in that Coast Guard installation; but he was equally proud of all of the military installations in his district; and as has been indicated by the other speakers, they are numerous. Herb was, indeed, proud of our defense family. He was proud of his district. He was proud of his State. I am not sure the gentleman from Virginia mentioned this, but he was, in fact, born in North Carolina. He may have said that early on. He was proud of this House, the people's House. Herb often referred to it in those words, the people's House, the Chamber closest to the people. Finally, he was proud of his family. I know that my colleagues will join me in extending to Laura and Herb's children our expressions of sympathy during this time of their bereavement.

We have only a few days left to provide real relief. A prescription drug benefit under Medicare is what they want. Now we are talking about reimportation of lower-cost drugs from Canada. That is fine. Let us do that. Although, I have to tell my colleagues, it is pretty crazy that we have to rely on the Canadian Government who puts some controls on the cost of drugs, the cost they are willing to pay, and we as Americans have to go and buy those same American-made drugs from the Canadians because we do not do anything to control the cost.

To the contrary, if adopted, it would likely retard the progress of legislation that would result in meaningful protections for Americans. ``Enacting this bill would give the appearance that Congress was finally doing something about protecting Americans' right to privacy when, in fact, it was not. Such a result would be unfair to the American people.'' I agree with the argument that the gentleman from Louisiana and others have made, and I would urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.

10620000033916|Mr. Speaker, enactment of federal legislation to protect the medical privacy of Americans has been a subject of congressional debate for years. More recently, with passage of the financial modernization legislation last year, financial privacy has been on the minds of millions, and electronic privacy concerns are becoming a major source of friction for dot.com companies and consumers. Legislative solutions in these areas are not simple. Inevitably, the rules that will do the most to protect consumers cause affected businesses to object that they would be burdensome and costly. But reasonable solutions are needed, or the fears that many harbor now-- that public and private entities they know nothing about are somehow gaining access without their knowledge to intimate information about them--will increasingly cause privacy-protective consumers to take extreme measures to avoid releasing as much personal information as possible. Or, they may simply decide to lie. Already, surveys tell us that some consumers are deciding not to seek certain medical treatments--genetic tests in particular--because they fear that the results could render them uninsurable. On the other hand, insurers insist that they have a right to seek and demand as much information as possible in order to accurately determine risk and premiums. Legislation is urgently needed to set boundaries and rules that are fair, reasonable, broad and balanced. There are many such bills that are pending in this Congress that would do much to advance the privacy agenda. Regrettably, they have been bottled up in committee. Among these bills are: H.R. 4380, a bill developed by the administration and introduced by Representative John LaFalce . The legislation would inform and empower consumers in the area of financial privacy by giving them the choice of saying ``yes'' or ``no'' before any disclosure of their medical information that is gathered by financial institutions . It would also allow consumers who chose to take the initiative to stop the transfer of other personal financial information that would otherwise take place. H.R. 4585, introduced by Representative Jim Leach would also enhance financial privacy protections by giving consumers an affirmative ``opt in'' choice before their medical information could be shared by financial institutions. The bill also features a federal private right of action. It was marked up by the House Banking Committee on June 29, where it was approved 26-14. H.R. 1941, introduced by Representative Gary Condit would give consumers control over the use and disclosure of their medical records, and private health plans, physicians, insurers, employers, and others clear rules for how medical records should be handled. Consumers whose privacy was violated would have legal redress through a private right of action. H.R. 4611, introduced by Representative Edward Markey features the administration's proposals to strengthen privacy protections for use of Social Security numbers. H.R. 3321, introduced by Representative Markey and Representative Bill Luther would provide comprehensive privacy protections on the Internet. H.R. 4857, introduced by Representative Clay Shaw and Jerry Kleczka was approved last week by the House Ways and Means Committee, and aims to curb identity theft with new rules restricting abuse of Social Security numbers. No floor action on the bill has yet been scheduled. By comparison, the bill on today's suspension calendar, the Privacy Commission Act offers no solutions. Instead, it calls for a 17-member commission to spend 18 months and $5 million to figure out what to do. There is nothing inherently wrong with studying privacy. But the majority party, in putting only this legislation on the floor during the 106th Congress, misses the main point, which is that we need to be legislating--not sitting on our hands and waiting for input from a commission that may or may not provide additional worthwhile insights on crafting sound privacy policy in 2002. Nor do we need a commission to second-guess the medical privacy regulations that will soon be issued by the Department of Health and Human Services. There are some in the health industry who are hoping a commission will call for further delay in the date on when the HHS regulations take effect, and who will use the commission to raise hypothetical concerns about their workability and cost. Yet the regulations are already subject to a 2-year implementation timeline, giving stakeholders a long lead-time to prepare and put in place some initial necessary safeguards to protect consumers' medical records from misuse and abuse. I urge my colleagues to raise their voices in support of real privacy legislation that will provide comprehensive medical, financial, and Internet protections for all Americans.|106039|001002|35|Hcr02oc00-59 1.txt|1213|1292|H8561-H8570|4824|748|CA|Pete Stark|H|13|Democratic

10620000038864|Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding me time, and I want to thank him for introducing this resolution, which I strongly support. At the outset, Mr. Speaker, let me express on behalf of all of us in this body our regret at the tragic deaths which have resulted from the violence that broke out in the Middle East. As a grandfather of 17, I particularly regret the death of children, although I recognize that there was a reckless and cynical exploitation of children by the Palestinian leadership. Children have no place in such violent demonstrations, and their reckless exploitation I think stands self- condemned. Mr. Speaker, once again the situation in the Middle East has turned from efforts to resolve the conflict peacefully to a new wave of violence that undermines the basis for peace between Israelis and Palestinians. No one is more supportive of the Middle East peace process than I am, Mr. Speaker. I also support the efforts to assist the Palestinians in their attempt towards moving towards self-government, increasing their economic well-being, and facilitating their cooperation in all areas with the Israelis. The current wave of violence, however, Mr. Speaker, is simply unacceptable. It is undermining the very basis for peace, the notion that Palestinians and Israelis can live together. In 1993, at Oslo, the principle of reconciliation was that the Palestinian leadership renounce violence as a means of achieving their political aims. In the last few weeks it has become obvious that Arafat and his group are unwilling to live up to this commitment. At Camp David, the government of Israel made sweeping proposals that moved the two sides closer than they have ever been in reaching a historic agreement and reconciliation. Instead of making a counterproposal to this most important move, Arafat has encouraged, promoted, and abetted violence and refused to engage in further negotiations. Even after an international summit prescribed the way of winding down this violence, the Palestinians continued their violent actions. These actions now show dangers of spilling over into other countries and have the potential of becoming a regional crisis. I therefore believe, Mr. Speaker, it is important that our resolution move forward at this time. Under our resolution, Congress expresses its solidarity with the state and people of Israel, condemns the Arafat leadership for doing so little to stop the violence, calls upon that leadership to refrain from further encouragement of violence and to show respect for all holy sites, and to settle all grievances through negotiations. Our resolution commends past and present administrations in their effort to find balanced resolutions to this long-standing conflict. Now all the parties in the region need to step back and to try to find the way to end this violence and to return to the negotiating table. That will not come very fast. We need to pass this resolution today to ensure that the Congress of the United States sends a clear message in support of peace and the State of Israel. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 426. Mr. Speaker, I submit for the Record the results of the General Assembly vote on Israeli actions in occupied territory.|106038|001024|18|Hcr24oc00-68 1.txt|210|265|H10646-H10655|3312|546|CA|Tom Lantos|H|12|Democratic

10620000048454|Mr. President, I rise today for myself and Senator Moynihan to introduce legislation that will make normal trade relations with the People's Republic of China permanent when China accedes to the World Trade Organization. The legislation I am introducing is the same as that sent up by the administration. It is a clean bill, and I believe we should keep it that way. Last year, the Chinese made a series of bold commitments to United States negotiators to open their market in return for WTO accession. In sector after sector--and by a date certain--the Chinese have pledged to open their markets to foreign goods, investment and services. These openings represent an unparalleled opportunity for U.S. farmers, manufacturers, and service providers to expand their exports into a rapidly growing market. Those commitments will help move the Chinese economy toward a rules- based system and end many forms of state control. In essence, China has conceded that its future depends on the replacement of its communist- style economy with an open, market-oriented system based on the rule of law. Indeed, in a number of sectors, economically backward China will be more open to American exports than some of our developed-country trading partners in Asia and Europe. What must the United States give away in terms of access to our market in return for China's pledge to enact these sweeping reforms? The answer is as striking as it is simple: absolutely nothing. The cost of our access to China's market is simply to comply with our own WTO obligations. Indeed, for the United States to reap the benefits of China's open markets once it joins the WTO, the only act necessary is passage of this legislation. This legislation will thus end the annual normal trade relations renewal process required by the Jackson-Vanik provisions in current trade law. Some believe we must retain the annual renewal process because it gives us leverage in checking China's conduct on a number of fronts. But the annual debate on renewing normal trade relations has not been a very effective means of achieving any of the goals we all share with respect to China: peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question; enhanced human rights, religious freedom and stronger worker rights for the Chinese people or curbing China's irresponsible behavior on security matters. But the active involvement of United States firms in China can only help open that society and reinforce the changes already under way in China toward free markets and a rules-based society. The enormous benefits of enacting permanent normal trade relations, on the other hand, are clear. Just as clear is the huge cost of failing to do so. In passing PNTR, American workers, farmers and exporters will gain access to market-opening concessions the Chinese made to our negotiators after 13 long years of hard negotiations. If we fail to pass PNTR, then every member economy of the World Trade Organization will gain such access except the United States. Our European, Japanese and Asian competitors could not hope for a more lucrative gift, and all at the expense of our farmers and workers. Here is what Leonard Woodcock, many years the President of the United Auto Workers, had to say in support of PNTR 2 weeks ago: With that sentiment I most strongly agree. What about the rights of Chinese workers themselves? On this point I agree with Mr. Woodcock, as well. To be sure, nothing in the U.S.-China trade agreement requires that free trade unions be formed in China. Yet the WTO does not require this of any of its 136-member countries, and the WTO is the wrong instrument to use to achieve that goal. We should, instead, be asking a more important question: Are Chinese workers better off with this agreement? The answer is a resounding yes. With so little to lose in ending the annual renewal process and so much to gain by enacting PNTR, I would hope this body will pass this legislation overwhelmingly.|106101|000323|1|Scr23mr00-182 1.txt|22|91|S1671-S1683|3947|661|DE|William Roth|S|NA|Republican

10620000050130|I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee. I congratulate Senator Roth for this amendment because this is not an easy one for him to do. The fact of the matter is, there is an assumption that there would be $1.2 billion in revenues resulting from this. But the question is, What is the appropriate thing to do? Again, Senator Roth, chairman of the Finance Committee, knows only too well how difficult it is to raise revenues, but I wanted to make sure we do the right thing. So I am pleased to support Senator Roth's amendment. It expresses very clearly the sense of the Senate that these provisions, those that allow drilling in the ANWR, are not to be included in this resolution. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the second largest wildlife refuge in the United States. It takes in a lot of territory, 19 million acres of mountains, forests, wetlands, wild rivers, tundra. It is home to a spectacular variety of plants and animals--caribou and polar bears, grizzly bears, wolves, quantities of migratory birds, the things that everyone of us would like our children and grandchildren to be able to see, to be able to believe that the animals that were here when their father or grandfathers or great grandfathers came on this Earth-- that they will be able to see them as well; not just in picture books, but in real life--grizzly bears and polar bears, wonderful things. A legacy is more important, frankly, than some of the money we are talking about to fund programs. The most important legacy we can leave our children and our grandchildren is a natural condition that enables them to see the animals, see the forests, go fishing in the streams, drink the water. That is the issue. The presence of these migratory birds, and grizzly bears, so many other species, in a nearly undisturbed state, have led some to call the area America's Serengeti. I have been to the Serengeti and I have been to the ANWR. I flew up there right after the Exxon Valdez ran aground. I was up there within 2 days of the time the Exxon Valdez ran aground. I was chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation, which had the Coast Guard as one of its responsibilities. The Coast Guard airplane picked me up and flew me up there immediately. I wanted to see what was happening. I will never forget the sight of that oil sheen floating across Prince William Sound. By then, very good people in our Government, the Forest Service and others, were up there picking up birds, seals--oil covered, couldn't breathe--on these tiny little islands, put there by helicopters. It looked like a dangerous assignment. But you could see the reach of the oil just fingering out all across Prince William Sound. It was a devastating thing to see. I was an environmentalist before I came here and I still am. By environmentalist I don't mean I just contribute to the environmental organizations or anything like that. I genuinely love the environment. It is the one thing that gives continuity through the ages that perhaps we can protect. The nearby Continental Shelf provides the coastal waters with a rich nutrient base, allowing the region high productivity which in turn supports an unusually wide variety of marine mammal diversity--ANWR. I flew across the ANWR in a single-engine airplane when I was up on my visit to Prince William Sound because I wanted to see what the area was like. What I saw were abandoned oil rigs in an area called Dead Horse, the Prudhoe Bay area. I saw rusting derricks and abandoned junk lying there. It was a pitiful blight on that beautiful expanse of nature. I then flew over the ANWR, this snow desert. I saw signs of some animals. It was a breathtaking sight. I then made a pledge to myself that I would do whatever I could to protect this pristine area. I owed it to my children who may never get up there to see it, but they have a relationship with that area that is inexplicable but nevertheless real. I returned from the South Pole in January. I am not an adventurer, but I am interested in what happens in our world. I went down there to see what was happening with climate change and the National Science Foundation. I went there to see whether or not there were things we could discover about our climate change and our environment about which we could do something. Scientists are still trying to search out what it is that is causing the ice melts in the South Pole that causes--I address myself to Senator Roth--a piece of the ice continent to break up, as they described it, twice the size of the State of Delaware and before that a piece the size of the State of Rhode Island. The next thing we know, we are going to see a piece floating out there the size of Texas, and then we will hear a squawk in here because that ice is melting rapidly. Seventy percent of the world's fresh water is stored in the South Pole. I relate the North and South Poles to our existence, and that environmental paradise called ANWR is part of that. Arctic ecosystems are delicately balanced and are some of the most ecologically sensitive ecosystems in the world. The harsh climate and short growing season leave very little time for species that have been harmed to adequately recover. The system's short food chains make a loss of a portion of the chain even more significant. This delicate balance can easily be disrupted by human intrusion. Oil exploration threatens the ecosystems that surround it through noise pollution, air pollution, on and offshore oil spills, and the destruction of the natural habitat. We all remember the horror of the Exxon Valdez spill--the images of the birds and seals and other animals covered in oil, their life literally being choked out of them. We remember the wide eyes on our children's faces as they watched the natural beauty of Alaska being destroyed. We saw it on television. According to the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council, many of the natural resources injured in that spill still show little, if any, sign of recovery. The danger is real. The Exxon Valdez spill took place in 1989. There was a lawsuit against Exxon. It was resolved in a damage suit which awarded $5.3 billion. Of that, $300 million has been paid-- $300 million in a $5.3 billion award. That was over 10 years ago. What restitution was given to the fishermen and those who depend on the area for their livelihood? What restitution was made to those species that were endangered, whether it was eagles, seals, ducks, you name it? Some of them suffocated because of the film of oil that covered their natural structure. Here we are. That is what happens when the environment is damaged. We are all aware of the problems this country is facing from higher oil prices, and our people should not have to pay for profiteering by OPEC, especially those people in the modest income category who depend on oil to heat their homes. Prices at the pump have risen dramatically in the last year. My own State of New Jersey was hit hard by extremely high prices for home heating oil during a surprisingly cold winter, as it was throughout the Northeast. The occupant of the Chair who is from the State of Rhode Island knows about what we are talking. We should use this wake-up call to increase our efforts in conservation. I have not heard two words about conservation.|106316|000405|452|Scr05ap00-106 1.txt|7774|7885|S2159-S2227|7277|1286|NJ|Frank Lautenberg|S|NA|Democratic

10620000055351|Mr. President, I will use what time I have remaining on the Lynch nomination for the Dyk nomination, and I will yield the floor to Senator Smith who wants to speak. Mr. Dyk has been nominated to the Federal circuit here in Washington. Mr. Dyk is a good lawyer, apparently with a good academic background, and has certain skills and abilities that I certainly do not dispute. I do not have anything against him personally, but I do have serious concerns about this court. I do not believe we need another judge on this court. The Federal circuit is a court of limited jurisdiction. It handles patent cases and Merit Systems Protection Board cases, certain international trade cases, and certain interlocutory orders from district courts. It is a specialized court and does not get involved in too many generalized cases. We have analyzed the caseload of this circuit. I serve on the Administrative Oversight and Courts Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee with Senator Chuck Grassley, who is chairman. I have been a practicing prosecutor for 15 years in Federal court before Federal judges; that is where I spent my career. I know certain judges are overwhelmed with work, and I have observed others who may not be as overwhelmed with work. I will go over some numbers that indicate to me without doubt that this circuit is the least worked circuit in America. It does not need another judge, and I will share this concept with fellow Members of the Senate. They handle appeals in the Federal Circuit, appeals from other court cases and boards. In 1995, there were 1,847 appeals filed in the Federal Circuit. Four years later, in 1999, that number had fallen to 1,543 appeals, a 16-percent decline in cases filed. Another way to look at the circuit is how many cases are terminated per judge. The Administrative Office of Courts provides a large statistical report. They analyze, by weighted case factors, judges and cases by circuits and districts and so forth. It is a bound volume. They report every year. The numbers are not to be argued with. The Federal Circuit has by far the lowest number of dispositions per judge. The Federal Circuit has 141 cases per judge terminated. There are 11 judges now on that circuit. As a matter of fact, those 141 cases were when the court had 10 judges. We now have 11 judges on that court, and we are talking about adding Mr. Dyk, who would be the 12th judge on that court, to take the numbers down even further. The next closest circuit is a circuit that is also overstaffed--the D.C. Circuit. I have opposed nominees to the D.C. Circuit in Washington. Oddly enough, both the circuits that I believe are overstaffed and underworked are located in this city. The average case dispositions for a circuit judge in America are more than double that. Let me provide some examples. The Third Circuit average number of terminations per judge is 312; the Fourth Circuit, 545; the Fifth Circuit, 668--that is four times what the Federal Circuit does--the Seventh Circuit, 352; Eighth Circuit, 440; Ninth Circuit, 455, the Tenth Circuit, 350; the Eleventh Circuit--my circuit, Florida, Alabama, and Georgia--820 cases, compared to 141. That is six times as many cases per judge in the Eleventh Circuit as in the Federal Circuit. The taxpayers of this country need to give thought to whether or not we need to add a judge to this circuit. It is pretty obvious we ought to consider that. Terminations per judge on the Federal Circuit represent only 17 percent of the cases terminated by a judge on the Eleventh Circuit. Senator Grassley issued a report on March 30, 1999, ``On the Appropriate Allocation of Judgeships in the United States Court of Appeals.'' The report assessed the need to fill one vacancy on the Federal Circuit. The court already had 11 active judges of the 12 authorized. The Federal Circuit also had five senior judges at that time. Senior judges contribute a lot to the workload. That is a pretty high number. Almost half as many judges are senior judges who come in on a less-work level. They don't handle the most important en banc cases, but they participate in drafting opinions. They have law clerks. Many of them do almost as many cases as an active judge. So they have five senior status judges. Maybe it is down to four now, but at that time there were five senior judges. The Grassley report states: That remains true today. The Federal circuit has 11 active judges now and 4 senior judges. On the issue of the cost of a judgeship, people ask, how much does it cost to add another judge? Just add a judge and pay his salary, $140,000, $150,000 a year? That is not too bad. However, the actual cost of a Federal judge is $1 million annually. They have two, three law clerks, secretaries, office space, libraries, computers, travel budgets, and everything that goes with being a Federal appellate judge. It is an expensive process. That number is a legitimate number, 1 million bucks. We have judges in this country who are working night and day, but this circuit is not one of them. Before we do not fill some of those vacancies, before we do not add new judges to some of those districts-- and it is not that many, but some are really overworked--we ought to think about whether we ought to continue a judge where we don't need one. The Grassley report also dealt with the problem of having more judges than you need, sort of a collegiality question. The report said: The Seventh Circuit had more than twice as many cases per judge as the Federal Circuit does today. The Grassley report further stated there is a consistency cost with expanding courts: The Federal Circuit, to which this judge would like to be appointed-- and it would be a good position to draw that big Federal judicial salary and have the lowest caseload in America --has the lowest terminations per judge of any circuit court of appeals. It has a 16- percent decrease in overall caseload, with a clear recommendation from the Grassley subcommittee report that there is not a need to add another judge to this circuit. I suggest that we not approve this judge, not because he is not a good person but because we don't need to burden the taxpayers with $1 million a year for the rest of his life to serve on a court that doesn't need another judge. In fact, they could probably get by with two or three fewer judges than they have right now and still have the lowest caseload per judge in America. We don't have money to throw away. People act as though a million dollars isn't much money. A million dollars is a lot of money where I came from. I think we ought to look at that and put our money where we have to have some judges. There are some of those areas. I thank the Chair for the time to express my thoughts on the Dyk matter and yield the remainder of my time to Senator Smith from New Hampshire.|106008|000523|38|Scr23my00-160 1.txt|2253|2386|S4261-S4290|6844|1213|AL|Jeff Sessions|S|NA|Republican

10620000066512|Since 1991, the marketing assessment has raised $279 million. That was my quote. That is a fact the Senator cannot dispute. This 132,000-ton purchase is a step toward preventing the forfeiture of a much larger amount of sugar. USDA has estimated that 600,000 tons could be forfeited at a much higher cost to the Government--the Senator from Arizona is correct--based on current programs and current forfeitures. Pulling that sugar from the market now costs substantially less. The purchase saves the Government money and promotes the stopping of this kind of effort based on forfeiture, and that does save the American taxpayer money. The purchase would not have been necessary and there would be no threat of forfeiture if sugar producers were not required, under the WTO and the North American Free Trade Agreement, to import about 15 percent of our consumption. I happen to have voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement because I felt this was a loophole that would potentially cost the producers of the State of Idaho their crops and maybe their farms. Now, of course, reality begins to bear itself out. Further compounding the problem has been extensive import quota circumvention by a term that is now well known by those of us who are interested in agriculture. It is known as stuffed molasses. Low prices for other crops driving producers to beet and cane sugar production and extremely favorable weather conditions for the last 2 years have all contributed to the oversupply of sugar and the need for Government intervention. Stuffed molasses, as my colleagues know, is a way of circumventing the law by loading up molasses with sugar, moving it through import into this country, then pulling it in and refining the sugar out of it. It is kind of like covering up, violating the law, if you will, in a legal way. It certainly violates the spirit of the trade agreement. Allowing sugar prices to continue to fall will put more sugar farmers out of business, but it will not help consumers one bit. There is a general assumption on the part of those who oppose the sugar program that once you drop the price of sugar to the world price, all of a sudden candy bars get cheaper, soda pop gets cheaper, confectionery foods get cheaper, and we know that is not the fact. It has never been the fact. We might transfer a little profitability from the sugar farmer to the candy maker or to the soft drink producer, or to those who generally supply confectionery goods to the consumers of this country. Does it translate through to the farmer? No, it does not, and it never has. While the price food manufacturers and makers of candy--cereal, ice cream, cookies, and cakes--pay for sugar--they will always pay that amount. That is the character of the way the industry works. They simply either make a little more or make a little less, based on the margins in which they buy. The truth of the matter is that in the U.S., the sugar program has saved the consumer money by stabilizing the price across the board and, therefore, consistency. I remember long before I served in the Senate, without this sugar program, there were dramatic fluctuations in the marketplace. People were going in and out of business. Confectionery producers and soft drink suppliers were arguing at one point that sugar was so dramatically high that they had to raise their prices, and then sugar fell dramatically, but those prices did not come down. U.S. consumers pay about 20 percent less for sugar than does a consumer in other developed countries of the world. It is strange that I could use that figure--and it is a figure of fact, well established in the marketplace. Why don't other developed countries' consumers pay what we do? They buy on the world market. They buy, as the Senator from Arizona suggests, at a much cheaper price. The reason is the stability we have offered and, therefore, the averages that are very important to look at when you are looking at an overall price of the issue. Do I support the program? Yes, I do. Am I apologetic for it? No, I am not. The reason is very simple. Over the years, we have worked to craft a program that balances itself out and, in large part, has paid for itself. As we work to create a more open market and phase these kinds of programs out, I will support those efforts, too.|106147|000720|52|Scr20jy00-72 1.txt|1331|1399|S7310-S7349|4324|756|ID|Larry Craig|S|NA|Republican

10720010006924|Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding to me and for his outstanding leadership, not only for the Blue Dog Coalition, but for this Congress and what I think are the next generations. Mr. Speaker, this is not rocket science. Anybody that can add and subtract can figure this out. We know what we need to do. A year ago at this time, the Blue Dog Coalition met with the director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mr. Daniels. He made a presentation to us at that time. He said this, and I will never forget it. He said, our greatest fear is that we are going to have so much money we are going to pay off all of the debt, and no one will have a safe place to invest their money because there will not be a U.S. Treasury bond. When we hear that said now, it seems absolutely and utterly ridiculous. To the Blue Dogs at that time, it seemed a bit risky and foolish to even think that way, but the fact is, we have squandered the surplus. We have squandered a great opportunity in this country. One thing that we know we must get under control is the spending. We know that we cannot continue to borrow and spend and pass the debt on to our children and grandchildren. The Blue Dogs have a four-point plan. We have worked diligently to come up with an honest assessment and an honest plan for what we need to do in this country to protect our children and grandchildren. We come to this floor almost on a weekly basis, and have a great debate about protecting the unborn. I personally believe that we should, and I always vote to protect the unborn. And yet, we will come here and vote for a policy that will allow us to pass massive debt on to the unborn. We vote for a policy that allows our fighting men and women to go overseas and serve this country with great distinction, and then we ask them, now, after the war is over, after their fighting is done, come back to this country and go to work, because we borrowed the money from them to pay for it. That is not right. It is immoral for us to continue to do that. Our plan would provide for the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 to be enhanced and reauthorized. It would provide that if we are going to spend additional money or we are going to reduce the amount of money coming in to the government, that we would reduce spending in a way to go along with that so we maintain a balanced budget. We provide a constitutional amendment that would allow this country to have a balanced budget without using the Social Security trust fund money to do it. It is not a balanced budget if we have to borrow the money from the Social Security trust fund to pay the bills. It is not a balanced budget if we just imagine that it is going to be balanced some day, like we have done in the past year. We cannot continue to do that. The Social Security taxes that are paid in by the senior citizens, that have been paid in by the senior citizens, and that are paid in today by the working men and women of this country are supposed to be used and set aside in a trust fund to pay the Social Security benefits when those people come of age. But right now, it amounts to only another income tax that is paid by the working men and women of this country, because we are spending every dime of it. We are not making any provisions to preserve the trust fund. We are not making any provisions to see that these obligations that we have when these people come of age to draw that money, that they are going to be able to receive it. It is irresponsible, and we should not continue to let this happen. It is amazing to me that we can have a budget this year that does not provide for medicine for our senior citizens in this country. We are going to spend money on a lot of things in this budget. We are going to appropriate money for a lot of things. Some of them are absolutely critical, but very few are more important than the good health of our senior citizens. It is amazing to me that we should allow one more year to pass in this Congress and not have a prescription drug benefit for our seniors because we have squandered the opportunity. The Blue Dogs have a plan to get out of the deficit ditch. We have a plan to prevent our children from having to pay the debts that we run up. I think it is time for the Congress and the administration to sit down, be honest, look at the real numbers, look at what we know we have to do, and not continue to pass the burden on to our children and grandchildren. One of the things I am proudest of in the time that I have served and represented the First Congressional District in the United States Congress is being a member of the Blue Dog Coalition. I think it is one of the most honest, determined groups that exist in this Congress. I think that their integrity is held together because they believe this is the right thing to do. I want to say once again how proud I am of their plan, and that I think that the Congress should take a serious look at this plan and pass these bills that we are proposing, and do something real for the future of our children.|107174|010509|27|Hcr09my01-14 1.txt|493|516|H2026-H2031|1434|251|IN|Tim Roemer|H|3|Democratic

10720010010297|Mr. Speaker, I would just like to remind my colleague on the other side of the aisle who just spoke that the Republican prescription drug plan would do nothing about bringing down the cost of prescription drugs, which is what is killing Americans, all Americans, and their plan would cover 6 percent of seniors instead of 90 percent of seniors who would like to have that kind of coverage. However, today, the House is going to vote on a very dangerous and cynical provision that allows the Federal Government to break its own spending limit, takes hundreds of billions of dollars from the Social Security trust fund. What they would like to do is hide this plan from the American people and what they want to do is to hide this debate today without leveling with the public, and what will happen is their plan is to take the Nation back into the deficit, raid Social Security. We oppose this plan. We support a responsible budget. What we need to be trying to do is to make investments in national security, protect Social Security and Medicare, do something about prescription drugs and the cost of those drugs in the United States today. It is time for the House Republicans to be straightforward with the American people. We need a responsible, honest, bipartisan budget. We need to protect and strengthen Social Security and shore up the prescription drug benefit, meet our obligations today so that our kids are not saddled with debt.|107233|010612|4|Hcr12jn01-114 1.txt|350|351|H3044-H3051|50|10|MA|John Tierney|H|6|Democratic
10720010010363|Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time. I want to commend the gentleman from Louisiana for his hard work in bringing together different bills in a bipartisan way that meet the public health threats that we face as a Nation. I particularly want to thank both Chairman Tauzin and Chairman Combest for including language in this bill to authorize an agricultural bioterrorism early- warning surveillance system for animal diagnostic laboratories. This network will provide early detection of bioterrorist events, natural or intentional contamination of our food supply, animal disease outbreaks involving agents which impact human health and early recognition of newly emergent and economically important diseases such as foot and mouth disease. The network will also enhance coordination between State and Federal laboratories as well as public health agencies. In my State, South Dakota State University will benefit greatly from this particular provision. Mr. Speaker, the infrastructure our Nation needs to protect and prepare itself for bioterror attacks cannot be overlooked. This legislation meets those needs so that people across our Nation can feel safe and secure with the understanding that should the worst happen, we will be ready. I ask my colleagues to support the conference report. Since the attacks of September 11th we have all become far more sensitive to the threat of a bioterrorist attack here at home. It is critical that our citizens feel secure at home, that our first responders are properly trained and prepared and that the food that crosses our borders is safe. I want to thank my colleague Chairman Billy Tauzin for his hard work to bring two different bills together in a bipartisan compromise that meets the public health threats we face as a Nation. This bill uses new ideas and new resources to help government officials at every level prepare for bioterrorist threats and public health emergencies. The bill authorizes more than $1.5 billion in grants to improve bioterror planning and preparedness and to develop new drugs, therapies and vaccines. The bill authorizes $300 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to upgrade and improve their facilities and capabilities. The bill authorizes more than $1.15 billion for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to expand medicine stockpiles and the purchase of additional small pox vaccines. The bill also grants authority to USDA to impose new registration requirements to regulate those agents that are most devastating to crops and livestock. Additionally, the bill creates tough new criminal penalties to enforce these important new regulations. Importantly, the bill authorizes $545 million for FDA and USDA to hire hundreds of new inspectors at our borders and to develop new methods to detect contaminated foods. The bill also provides new regulatory powers to FDA to safeguard our food supply. These new resources and authorities will substantially improve the federal government's ability to ensure the safety of America's food supply. Finally, I would like to thank both Chairman Tauzin and Chairman Combest for including language to authorize an agricultural bioterrorism early warning surveillance system for animal diagnostic laboratories. This network will provide early detection of bioterrorist events, natural or intentional contamination of our food supply, animal disease outbreaks involving agents which impact human health and early recognition of newly emergent and economically important diseases such as Foot and Mouth Disease.

10720010011939|Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking the Committee on the Judiciary and especially the gentleman from Wisconsin for taking a good hard look at this legislation that was proposed by my good friend, the gentleman from Utah , and myself. When we first brought this legislation to the attention of the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, the gentleman from Wisconsin , I am sure, Mr. Speaker, he had his doubts about what the Representative from Utah and the Representative from Nevada had in mind, or what these two Westerners were even up to. But he took his time to study this issue, learn about the two communities, and the Committee on the Judiciary chairman even paid us a visit to the two communities of West Wendover, Nevada, and Wendover, Utah. Let me say to the gentleman from Wisconsin , we want to thank him for taking a thoughtful look at this bill and hearing directly from those who will be most affected by any potential annexation, our constituents in both Nevada and Utah. Mr. Speaker, so that each of my colleagues can get a better understanding of this legislation, let me provide a brief explanation to expand on what I believe will be the comments of the gentleman from Utah later on. First arriving in Washington, D.C., during the 105th Congress, both the communities of Wendover, Nevada, and West Wendover, Utah, have approached me on the idea of forming a single Wendover. As the gentleman from Utah will articulate, because of the unique circumstance, these two communities are already virtually a single community, separated by an invisible line through their community, which happens to divide the State of Utah and the State of Nevada. But where they appear to be virtually one, as anybody who has ever driven I-80 west from Salt Lake City could attest to, they are not a single community. As a matter of fact, these two small communities live with an onerous duplication of services, including fire, police, court systems, as well as separate utility and school systems. There are two Wendovers. Each serve as one of the friendliest places out West, but they represent perhaps the least efficient two communities in the West. Indeed, these two communities have been exploring the idea of becoming one Wendover for several years and, together with the gentleman from Utah , we want to give them that opportunity. To clear up the confusion that often accompanies this legislation, passage of H.R. 2054 will not move the State boundary. What it will do is give the consent of this body that the two communities, through the State governments in Nevada and Utah, can begin negotiation of an annexation agreement process. The two State legislatures would have to ratify one agreement, an agreement which would then, and only then, provide for such annexation and joining of these two communities, as should be agreed to in order to take place. Mr. Speaker, this legislation is not a mandate on the communities. This November, both West Wendover, Nevada and Wendover, Utah will vote on the referendum to determine how they wish to proceed on this issue, and this is exactly how the gentleman from Utah and I envision the process of carrying this out. Let the local communities decide their fate and give Congress the ability to provide our consent by supporting H.R. 2054. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the Committee on the Judiciary, and I urge support for this bill.|107525|010621|5|Hcr21jn01-55 1.txt|101|181|H3363-H3437|4816|800|WA|Norman Dicks|H|6|Democratic

10720010017592|Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, my grandfather used to be in town politics and county politics for about 30 years. And one of the things that he always told me is that the most dangerous thing you could do in politics is to believe your own baloney. And I think the problem that we have in this House is that there are a number of people who are so enamored of their own baloney that they do not even recognize it is baloney, and let me explain what I mean. I appreciate the kind personal comments that the gentleman from Wisconsin made about this gentleman from Wisconsin. But I think we need to fairly analyze why it is that we have people with their noses out of joint tonight. We have a group of people in this House , we have a group of people in this House who honestly believe that they can maintain the fiction that somehow the budget resolution which passed this House is a real instrument in divided government. It is not. And the problem we face is that when you start the budget process with an erroneous initial set of assumptions, then everything that happens after that point is a colossal waste of time. And so because we started with a budget resolution, which for the third year in a row makes an unrealistic assumption about what in the end the collective judgment of people on both sides of the aisle is going to be with respect to the budget, we wind up starting from a false base to begin with. And now you have a number of people in this House who are upset because we will not stick to that false base. Now, the previous gentleman from Wisconsin who spoke has me confused because he talks about the Committee on Appropriations unraveling the budget process. I would say that if he wants to look to a committee that has unraveled the process, he ought to start with his own committee. Our committee operates in an unusually bipartisan fashion. We do not agree on everything, but we often resolve our differences. We had some major differences on this bill which we resolved. In contrast, my observation is that the Committee on Ways and Means, the other side of the financial ledger, is so polarized that they often are barely speaking to each other. And the products that they bring to the floor demonstrate that as well. Because those products have essentially said that over the next 10 years we are going to spend $1.7 trillion on tax reductions, and that is going to come largely out of borrowed money. Now, I happen to think that tax cuts in the short term make sense because if the economy is sagging, you need to give the economy a kicker. And I do not think there is anything wrong with in the short run having some stimulus in the tax side as well as the spending side. But the problem with the markets is that they are looking at the long- term result of that decision, and that $1.7 trillion in lost revenue over the next 10 years makes the differences on appropriations bills appear to be minuscule by comparison. Does anybody really think the budget is going to be balanced if this amendment is passed tonight? Come on, give me a break. The other thing I would point out is that I am, frankly, a little baffled because I have one gentleman from Wisconsin on that side of the aisle say we are going to spend too much money; and yet we are noticed by another gentleman from Wisconsin on that side of the aisle that he is going to ask us to spend more money on a program that is important to him and to me, Chronic Wasting Disease. Now he has an offset for that amendment, and I congratulate him for it; but the problem is that offset is going to be met with bipartisan opposition because the program that is being cut means as much to the folks who want that program as the program that the other gentleman from Wisconsin wants to see money added to, the Chronic Wasting Disease for the deer herd and the elk herd means to us. So the Committee on Appropriations has committed the unpardonable sin of bringing to the House floor a realistic document which represents our best professional judgment on a bipartisan basis.|107401|010725|1|Hcr25jy01-86 1.txt|17|36|H4594|1082|177|OK|Ernest Istook|H|5|Republican

10720010022619|Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the resolution. Today is the 1-year anniversary of the most horrific attack on American soil in our history. On September 11, 2001, freedom-hating terrorists took from all of us our sense of innocence. They took from all of us the idea that innocent men, women and children going about their daily lives are immune from the horrors of war. They took from all of us the sense of safety and security to which we had become accustomed. What they did not take from us and what they could not ever take from us, no matter how hard they tried a year ago, is our freedom and liberty, our way of life, our government of the people, by the people and for the people. New York Governor Pataki opened the memorial ceremony at Ground Zero this morning with the reading of the Gettysburg Address which President Lincoln delivered in 1863, barely 100 miles from where the passengers of United Flight 93 heroically stopped terrorists from their attempt to, I believe, destroy this very building. Part of President Lincoln's address includes these words: ``That from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave their last full measure of devotion, that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this Nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom.'' We, too, are dedicated to a new birth of freedom here in this new century. The horrible events of last September 11 have reawakened in all Americans a new sense of patriotism; a strength, a resolve that had lain dormant for far too long. The flags we see flying in every neighborhood across America today were not put up this morning. They have been there for the last year. The support of the American people for our men and women fighting overseas has remained unwavering, and the kind words and deeds of our fellow man seem all the more common today, 1 year later. Eugene McCarthy once observed that America can choke on a gnat, but swallow tigers whole. This is a tiger that we as a Congress and as a Nation must deal with, and we will. There is no lack of resolution here. There is no rancor. We will continue to stand behind the President. We will continue to do what we must do to keep those who hate our values and ideals from committing evil acts against us ever again. Today let us honor and pay tribute to those who were taken from us before their time and resolve to remember them always. But let us also resolve that our commitment to the Republic that our Founders risked their own lives to create more than 200 years ago is stronger than ever. The foundation of our Nation is solid, and so is our dedication to her. Mr. Speaker, God bless America.|107544|010913|44|Hcr13se01-62 1.txt|823|823|H5598-H5605|48|10|WI|Jim Sensenbrenner|H|9|Republican

Madam Speaker, number one, I would like to say that working on the Committee on Education and the Workforce has been truly a wonderful experience. To me it is a committee that actually has worked very well bipartisanly to get things done. I appreciate that. Sometimes I wish other committees could look at how our committee works to get things done so we can sign legislation into law. I also would like to thank the staff for all of the hard work they put in. A lot of people do not realize how much work the staff does to make this legislation come through. The gentleman from South Carolina , he and I will be working very hard to make sure that this legislation now moves in the Senate to get signed by the President. Madam Speaker, today we are talking about the next step about providing needy relief to the victims of September 11. It is my hope that the other body will move quickly to pass this important legislation so we can send this bill to the President for his signature. Madam Speaker, I commend my colleagues, especially the gentleman from Ohio and the gentleman from California , who have spoken in favor of this bill; and I urge Members to vote in favor of this legislation, H.R. 5091.

10720010028658|Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of our mission to protect and secure the homeland, but also to oppose the efforts of those who excuse corporate expatriation. Since September 11th, this nation has pulled together to fight the war on terrorism. And now, with more military action looming, we must face the fact that fighting a war and combating terrorism costs money. To fully fund the needs of our military and homeland security, every American taxpayer, individual and corporation alike, must be prepared to pay their fair share. If corporate expatriates are not paying their tax bills , the American people know that someone will have to pick up the slack. We should use everything in our arsenal to stop corporate expatriation. No more government contracts for financial traitors. No more tax benefits for runaway corporations. I regret that the Republican leaders struck the very reasonable federal contract ban from this bill--a ban supported by 318 Members of this House--and inserted instead an ineffective provision that affects no one. Corporate expatriates cheat the federal government out of needed tax revenues and then have the audacity to return for a federal hand-out. However, the sensible contract ban passed by the House and then championed in the Senate by the late Paul Wellstone, was watered down to the ineffective provision we are debating today. Regrettably, this provision only affects companies who leave after the date of enactment. It makes as much sense as closing the barn door after all the cows are out. Let's take Tyco, formerly of New Hampshire, now of Bermuda, for example. Tyco, which will be unaffected by the ban in this bill, avoids paying $400 million a year in U.S. taxes by setting up a shell headquarters offshore, but was awarded $182 million in lucrative defense and homeland security related contracts in 2001 alone. If Tyco had just paid its tax bill, Congress could have easily paid for 400 explosive detection systems , which are badly needed to protect U.S. travelers at airports around the nation. Or let's examine corporate expatriate Ingersoll-Rand, formerly of New Jersey, and now also in Bermuda. Ingersoll-Rand, also unaffected by this bill, earned as much last year in U.S. defense and homeland security federal contracts as it avoids in U.S. taxes annually merely by renting a mailbox in Bermuda and calling it `home.' If Ingersoll- Rand paid its U.S. tax bill, Congress could easily fund the proposed Cyberspace Warning Intelligence Network estimated to cost $30 million, or could also buy 400,000 gas masks for American citizens. Mr. Speaker, the leadership of this House has thwarted all efforts to have a legitimate debate and vote on HR 3884, The Corporate Patriot Enforcement Act, a bipartisan bill to deny the benefits to corporations who flee to tax havens. We must show the American people that this Congress will not coddle corporate abusers. These financial traitors are escaping income taxes, and then, profiting from the very government they have left behind. I urge my colleagues to fight for tax fairness, any way we can get it.|107344|011101|16|Hcr01no01pt2-27 1.txt|412|414|H7701-H7707|127|21|NY|Benjamin Gilman|H|20|Republican

10720010029508|Additionally, we proposed giving workers a refundable, advanceable tax credit towards the purchase of health insurance equal to 50 percent of the policy's cost. So we moved away from a national emergency grant program to one that is probably more dynamic, with more flexibility for the workers--a tax credit for those who are unemployed to continue the insurance they had where they previously worked and were laid off; and even go beyond that, for people to have health insurance even if they did not have health insurance at their previous job before they were laid off. Democrats objected, claiming that the credit was too small and that sicker people would have trouble buying policies in the individual market. So there was one gripe after another, but we tried to satisfy those gripes to reach a consensus agreement which ended up being the bipartisan centrist-White House program. Our new proposal then was endorsed by the White House even though the President had suggested another approach. It was endorsed by the White House, the House of Representatives, and by the bipartisan centrist group of this body. That program takes a three-pronged approach to getting health insurance assistance to those dislocated workers who used to have health insurance where they first worked. Now they are unemployed. Now they do not have health insurance. Now they would have health insurance under the White House-centrist bipartisan package, but they would not have it under the Daschle amendment before the Senate. Our proposal goes further and wider than any proposal on the table to date and gets more help to more people more quickly than any other proposal to date. What is more, it represents a giant leap in spending on health care. It includes over six times as much money for temporary health insurance assistance as our original Republican, and admittedly partisan, proposal. The House-passed stimulus bill--what the President said he would sign, and the centrist group in the Senate backs--would spend approximately $19 billion on temporary health insurance in the year 2002. And it does it the right way, by using existing programs, along with new ones, designed to get people the help they need quickly. Now I take a minute to describe our three-pronged approach. First, the White House-centrist bipartisan proposal provides a refundable, advanceable tax credit to all displaced workers eligible for unemployment insurance, not just those eligible for COBRA. The value of the credit is 60 percent of the premium, instead of the 50 percent in our original proposal. The credit has no cap and is available to individuals for 12 months between the years 2001 and 2003. Individuals can stay in their employer COBRA coverage or they can choose policies in the individual markets that may better fit their families' needs. This only makes sense because locking people into COBRA, as the Democratic leadership insisted prior to Christmas--and it is not even in their proposal now--forces people to stay with policies that may be too expensive for them to keep, even with a 60-percent subsidy. Our goal was to give dislocated workers access to all health insurance choices available to them in the private marketplace. We have done that in a responsible way that uses the dynamics of the marketplace rather than the straitjacket of a Government program to deliver the help. This bipartisan White House-centrist proposal includes major new insurance reforms to protect people who have had employer-sponsored coverage and go out into the private market for the first time after being laid off. It makes the COBRA protections available to people who have had only 12 months of employer-sponsored coverage, rather than 18 months as under current law. By doing this, we greatly expand the group of displaced workers who cannot be turned down for coverage or excluded from any insurance because of preexisting conditions. The new 12-month standard is especially important for people with chronic conditions who have difficulty obtaining affordable coverage. It is a major step, and I am surprised that the Democratic leadership does not want to take us up on these sweeping new reforms. I turn now to the mechanics of the tax credit proposal. It is much easier to implement than the direct subsidy approach that the Democratic leadership has had in some of their proposals. But there is nothing on health insurance in the Democratic amendment before us. They just forget about the needs of the dislocated workers who used to have health insurance who do not have it now because they are unemployed. While the Democrat proposal requires employers to shoulder the burdens, our proposal relies on existing State unemployment insurance systems. So under this bill, workers will be able to access the credit and begin applying it to their health insurance premiums in a timely way. Let me explain the workings of it. Newly dislocated workers will receive certificates from their State unemployment offices, or ``one stop'' centers, when they apply for unemployment insurance. You can take care of both needs at one time-- unemployment insurance and continue your health insurance from the previous employer. Or if you did not have it there, you can get a certificate to go out and get it for the first time. So you take those certificates and submit them, along with their contribution to the premium, to their employer or insurer, and move on with insurance. Afterwards, insurers then would submit the certificates to the Treasury Department for reimbursement. This approach works because it relies on existing systems to deliver new benefits and, as a result, delivers those benefits in a fast and reliable way. I ask my colleagues, why would anyone insist on a mechanism that just will not deliver the goods to the people who need them? In other words, people who became unemployed yesterday have lost their health insurance, they cannot afford to keep their COBRA up, or maybe they are unemployed from a place that did not even have health insurance and then have to institute some system where they have to wait a long time to get the help. I do not understand the wait. The second prong of this proposal is $4 billion in enhanced national emergency grants for the States, which can be used to help all workers--not just those eligible for the tax credit--to pay for health insurance. States have flexibility under our approach and can use these grants to enroll their workers in high-risk pools or other State-run plans, or even enroll them in Medicaid if the State decides. To address concerns raised by Democratic colleagues, our enhanced national emergency grant program requires all States to spend at least 30 percent of their grant money on temporary health insurance assistance. In addition, we have included protections for the States--a minimum grant of at least $5 million for any State that meets the grant criteria. Finally, the third prong of the proposal responds to Democratic requests by including $4.3 billion for a one-time temporary State health care assistance payment to the States to help bolster their Medicaid Programs. Just this Monday, I had a State senator from Davenport, IA, speak to me at one of my town meetings about the needs of the States for additional Medicaid funds. I said to her that Governor Vilsack and Republican leaders and Democratic leaders had a conference call with me on that very subject before Christmas. I said we have this $4.3 billion in this White House-centrist bipartisan package that the President will sign, that has passed the House of Representatives. What you need to do is get Governor Vilsack, I said to our State Senator, who I said I would help, get him to call Senator Daschle and ask this bill to come up, and you will have Iowa's share of this $4.3 billion. As we know, the Medicaid program is an important safety net for low- income children and families and disabled individuals. Medicaid is a joint Federal and State program that accounts for a large part of State budgets. So in this time of budget constraints due to recession, States are struggling to make ends meet. Iowa is one of those. In fact, I think I read in the newspapers that there are 40 States that have very serious budget problems, and Medicaid is probably the biggest one of those budget problems in almost all of those States. So as a result of the unique and extraordinary economic situation we now face, we need to help those States rather than having those States scale back Medicaid services, including my own State of Iowa. I think we are going to be scaled back by $18 million. This provision provides a one-time emergency cash injection that will help States avoid Medicaid cutbacks. This feature was not part of our original plan. I just say that. You might ask: Senator Grassley, why didn't you have it in your original plan? Well, the process of legislation is evolution of a bill. There are very few bills in Congress that are introduced and passed as they are originally introduced. I would not pretend to believe that every bill I introduce is a perfect piece of legislation. This process of negotiation on these, listening both on the Republican side and the Democratic side, is one of improving a piece of legislation, and even after that is done, with new ideas in it, you have to recognize that many of our colleagues have concerns about even this provision. In fact, I share their reservations, and that is why I am emphasizing that this is not simply a garden variety increase in Medicaid funding; this is to meet the temporary emergency payments that result from a downturn in the economy because of the terrorist attacks of September 11 that have not only affected the Federal budget situation but most of our States. This Nation is calling for a bipartisan compromise. In that spirit, we have agreed to add this proposal on Medicaid to our bill. We made tremendous steps towards the Democratic position in order to find bipartisan compromise on health care, a compromise on health care that is not even in the Democratic proposal that is before the Senate. I said that what we have included in here our Republicans would vote for, I think, maybe except for two Republicans. And then we have enough Democrats that make up a majority to get this bill passed. But those steps have not been reciprocated by the Democratic leadership. Displaced workers then deserve to be treated with respect by this body, and I believe those workers have earned a vote on this bill. In other words, the House has passed this bipartisan White House-centrist package. The President has said he would sign it. So if we have a majority vote here, we could pass this, and it would be out of the way. We would be stimulating the economy, and we would be helping dislocated workers. It is necessary for me now to discuss the individual income tax reductions in the White House-centrist plan and also compare this to the skeletal plan put forth by our distinguished majority leader. The original House stimulus bill would have accelerated the reduction of the 27 percent rate to 25 percent. That otherwise would not be scheduled to go into effect until the year 2007. The White House- centrist package has adopted this approach. Here is another thing on the charts that the majority leader used in his speech this morning. He referred to ``rates reduction''--plural, ``rates.'' We have one rate reduction, the 25 percent bracket, or let's say the 27 percent down to 25. We don't change other rates. We do have other tax provisions, the tax rebate for low-income people. So we have the White House-centrist bipartisan package helping these middle class taxpayers. The skeletal Democrat plan doesn't do this. It does not provide one red cent of tax relief for people who are working for a living, not even one cent of tax relief for working Americans. So let's take a look at who will benefit from our planned rate reduction. I have some charts I will be referring to. The reduction of the 27 percent rate will benefit singles with taxable income of at least $27,000. I want people to think about this, a single person with income as little as $27,000. Somebody is going to be saying before the day is out that these people are not overtaxed. I would like to have you ask people making $27,000 if they couldn't use a reduction of their income tax from 27 percent down to 25 percent. They would probably laugh at us for suggesting that that is not enough. We are talking about heads of households that would have income as little as $36,250 and married couples with taxable income as low as $45,000. These are not wealthy individuals. These are middle class working Americans. I have the chart I referred to that Members can see. I want them to see what the median income for a four-person family for every State in the Nation. Median income is the amount of income right in the middle, with half the incomes above and the other half below. Our chart shows that the average median income for a four-person family in the United States, as we can see, is $62,098. A family of four now, that is the average. Remember, half are below and half are above. A reduction of the 27 percent rate to 25 will benefit married couples with taxable income over $45,000. So it will benefit working people who are well below the national median income level. This chart also shows those States that have family median income that is higher than the national average. And so we can look at where these people live: Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Michigan, Rhode Island, California, Washington State. These are the States where a family of four will benefit the most from our proposed tax cuts. The more surprising figures are shown in the next chart. We can see the States with median income below the national average. So you recall that I said that reducing the 27 percent rate to 25 percent will benefit married couples with taxable incomes over $45,000. Look at the median income distribution of this chart. You can see from this chart that there is not one State on the list that has a median family income of less than $45,000. So you can see that our proposal will benefit everyone, not just the elite few, not just from a few selected States. But the distinguished majority leader's Democratic skeletal plan provides no relief for these States. The Treasury Department has estimated that the White House- centrist bipartisan plan's acceleration of the 27 percent rate will yield $17.9 billion of tax relief in the year 2002 for over 36 million taxpayers. That is one-third of all income tax payers. Small business owners and entrepreneurs account for 10 million or 30 percent of those benefiting from this rate reduction. When you refuse to accelerate the rate cuts, you harm farmers and small businesspersons the most. That is because most small businessowners and farmers operate their businesses as sole proprietors, sub-S corporations, partnerships. The income in these types of entities is reported directly in individual tax returns. Therefore, a rate reduction for individuals reduces taxes for farmers and small businesses. That is why the rate reduction under the bipartisan White House-centrist plan is so important. In 2002 alone, it injects $17.9 billion of stimulus into our ailing economy, and it helps small businesses that create the new jobs. So what would a small business do with these tax savings? Well, considering that most of the recent job growth has come from small businesses, I believe they would feel safe hiring more people and making more business investment. We know that 80 percent of the 11.1 million new jobs created between 1994 and 1998 were from businesses with less than 20 employees. Eighty percent of American businesses have fewer than 20 employees. That is why I refer to this as the 80-80 rule for supporting tax reductions. In addition, lowering taxes now would increase business cashflow during the current economic slowdown. The higher cashflow would increase demand for investment and labor. Don't just take my word for it because we have the National Bureau of Economic Research. They produced, in October 2000, a publication called ``Personal Income Taxes and the Growth of Small Firms.'' As you know, the National Bureau of Economic Research is a well-regarded, nonpartisan organization. It is the organization that determines when official recessions begin and when they end. They said this one began in March 2001. If we trust them to make that determination, I hope we trust the conclusions reached in their report. Their report on individual taxes and small business growth reaches the unambiguous conclusion that when a sole proprietor's marginal tax rate goes up, the rate of growth of his or her business enterprise goes down. Simply stated, high personal income tax rates discourage the growth of small business and right now, in a recession, that is the last thing we need. That is why it is important to do rate reductions and do them the right way and fully accelerate the 27-percent rate reduction. We are simply accelerating a decision the Senate made last summer. We should not, as has been suggested by some in the Democratic leadership, repeal rate reduction or, to state it correctly, we should not increase taxes. Again, that is the last thing you should do in a recession. We know tax cuts are stimulative. When working Americans have more of their own income, they are more financially secure and comfortable with spending. Let me say who really loses when this body fails to act. It is our displaced workers, it is our fellow Americans who still have a job, it is the security of our job base, and it is the soundness of the Nation's economy. The Senate Democrat leadership will not allow an up-or-down vote on our bipartisan White House-centrist stimulus package. At least that was the way it was before our holiday break. The reason why I don't think they allowed it to be done is because it would pass. We have a majority of Senators--obviously, a bipartisan majority. Obviously, this proposal comes from the center of the Senate, from conservative Democrats and moderate Republicans. So what. That is how you get things done in the Senate. I might not agree with everything in the package. I might be considered more conservative than those who put it together, but it is a good package. More importantly, it meets the needs of our country post-September 11. It meets the needs of those dislocated workers, those people who don't have health insurance. So now where are we? We are at a point where the distinguished majority leader has offered the skeletal remains of that package. But I don't think there is a majority of Senators supporting that move. When you get it all said and done, it doesn't help those people who don't have health insurance. I urge Senators to think twice before supporting something less than the full stimulus package that was written by Democrats and Republicans in the center of the Senate and that was so done in a way that satisfies the White House for signature. We need to enact a plan that will stimulate the current economy and serve as insurance against a second downturn in the next few years. For those in this body, both Republican and Democrat, there are a few who say we will be better off if we don't pass the stimulus package, or that we are recovering and we might not need it. I say to them, remember that most recessions have a double downturn. They have it when the original recession kicks in, and then they have an upturn, and then they have a down tick. A down tick probably is not a negative growth situation, but it is still a downturn. This stimulus package will be insurance against having a steady rise in the economy over the next few years, with no down tick, as is traditional for some recoveries. We need to enact a plan that will stimulate the current economy and give us that insurance. The White House-centrist bipartisan package does that. I hope the Senate hears the pleas of the American people and will support a comprehensive stimulus package--one that aids displaced workers, tends to their health care needs, and gives a real turbocharge to our economy, and to do that into a full recovery, a recovery without a down tick, so those who need a job can get it and those who have a job can keep it and relieve a lot of anxiety--particularly anxiety over not having health insurance, which unemployed people have.

10720010038724|Mr. President, the opportunity to seek a quality higher education has long enticed men and women to leave their homelands to travel to America. We are, by and large, a generous Nation when it comes to providing an education to foreign citizenry. Indeed, American colleges, universities, and technical schools have opened wide their doors to students from foreign lands. And all levels of schooling are available to foreign nationals of every age--from preschool to post-graduate work, from public grade schools to private technical-training institutions. In fact, foreign students have proven to be a lucrative source of revenue for U.S. educational institutions. Private-sector analysts estimate that foreign students contribute between $9 billion and $13 billion to the U.S. economy every year. Any number of marketing efforts are made by colleges and universities to recruit foreign students, whose tuition fees serve to bulk up college budgets. As a result, we have opened our borders to a stream of foreign students with precious little oversight of their movement through the American educational stream. According to the INS, there are currently 2 million foreign students admitted to study in this country--649,000 of whom were admitted just last year. These include nuclear engineering scholars, biochemistry students, and pilot-trainees, who have access to sensitive technology, training, and information. Yet while our schools have been training would-be pilots in the art of flying airliners, we have been asleep at the switch! There has been too little accountability, and too few checks, largely because oversight has proven too burdensome and costly for the government and the U.S. educational industry. The lax government oversight of these student visa beneficiaries was underscored by the fact that three of the September 11 hijackers were awarded student visas--not to mention the fact that the INS was still processing the student visa applications for two of them 6 months after they had crashed two planes into the World Trade Center towers and gone on to meet their eternal destiny. Clearly INS has not been up to the job of monitoring foreign students, and, in its current condition, placing new burdens on that agency alone is no solution. Therefore, as we look at our Nation through the prism of the new realities of terrorism, we must reconsider ways to involve those who have the best opportunity to prevent attacks. We need the assistance of our educational institutions. In recent years, efforts to impose more stringent reporting requirements on schools have faltered because educational institutions have been reluctant to get into the job of monitoring foreign students. In fact, colleges and universities have lobbied heavily against such requirements, and the current lack of a national program to monitor foreign students indicates the effectiveness of that lobbying effort. The pending legislation takes some important steps toward closing many of the loopholes in our foreign student policies that could be exploited by a potential terrorist. If the student monitoring provisions in this bill are to be successful, however, we must ensure the participation of our schools. These institutions are best suited to inform the INS and the State Department as to which students have been accepted to attend a school, whether they actually show up for class once they enter the country on a student visa, and whether they continue their classes or merely drop out of sight after checking in with the admissions office. Monitoring the student via program requires a partnership between the government and all colleges, and technical schools that accept foreigners. The pending bill gives the INS and the Secretary of State too much discretion in determining whether or not these educational institutions should be penalized. Section 502 of this bill reads: What's more, in section 502 of this bill, the ``periodic reviews,'' which the INS Commissioner, Secretary of State, and Secretary of Education are required to make to determine whether institutions are complying with this legislation, are not defined. A ``periodic review'' could mean every 5 years or it could mean every 20 years or it could mean every 50 years. That is very soft language. My amendment would require reviews by the relevant agency heads at least once every two years. Further, if they found that U.S. educational institutions were materially not complying with the reporting requirements in this bill, my amendment would require the relevant agency heads to terminate or suspend, for at least one year, the right of those institutions to accept foreign students. This amendment makes clear the serious concern about this Nation's ability to help foreign students while also protecting our homeland. Educational institutions are essential partners in our efforts to ensure that foreign students really are ``students'' with no other agenda but learning. I thank Senators Kennedy, Brownback, Feinstein, and Kyl for their support of this amendment. I hope that the Senate will adopt it. Mr. President, I have made my statement prior to calling up the amendment. I ask unanimous consent that the time I have consumed in reading my statement come out of my time on the amendment.|107276|010228|1|Scr28fe01-200 1.txt|16|18|S1719-S1720|177|27|MS|Trent Lott|S|NA|Republican

10720010040378|I would like to echo the comments of my partner on the Appropriations Committee. Over the years, Senator Harkin and I have funded the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and we've been able to watch its growth under the able leadership of Dr. Jeffrey Koplan. Let me list for you just a few of his many successes while working at CDC and as its Director. Perhaps most important was Dr. Koplan's ambitious and much-needed campaign to upgrade CDC's buildings and facilities, enabling the agency to better protect the nation's health and safety. He invited Senator Harkin and I to visit the CDC labs in Atlanta, where we found our nation's laboratories in a deplorable condition. We've been happy to support his effort to upgrade these facilities and, if any of you had the same opportunity to visit the CDC labs, I'm sure you'll agree that this effort was long overdue and will serve this country well for years to come. Dr. Koplan had many other accomplishments during his tenure at CDC including the establishment of a system that will take the pulse of our nation's health through a quick computerized disease reporting system to which local health departments will be linked; focusing the nation's attention on the obesity and diabetes epidemics threatening the health of millions of Americans; and summarizing patterns of tobacco use among women and called for stronger national and local efforts to implement proven solutions to reduce and prevent tobacco use among women and girls. Over the past two years, the CDC has aided State, local and international health authorities over 200 times, to investigate outbreaks of disease, including anthrax, West Nile Virus, Ebola, tuberculosis, sexually transmitted diseases, lead poisoning, birth defect clusters, homicide-suicide clusters, nutritional deficiencies, and flood-related illnesses. The CDC, along with NIH and FDA, initiated a new plan to prevent bovine spongioform encephalopathy, also known as ``mad cow'' disease, from affecting the U.S. food supply. As a result, the U.S. has one of the safest food supplies in the world. Last but certainly not least, Dr. Koplan led our nation's public health authorities in becoming better prepared to respond quickly and effectively to a bioterrorist attack on this country. And, indeed, he was our country's public health leader during the first such attack, working around the clock to prevent people exposed to anthrax from developing the disease. Because this was a new reality for our nation, Dr. Koplan placed special emphasis on learning every lesson possible from the experience so that we are now better prepared should we face another attack. I commend him for all that he has done to protect the health and well-being of the American people. I wish him well.&lt;bullet&gt;|107300|010313|229|Scr13mr01-117 1.txt|2749|2750|S2184-S2214|65|12|NV|Harry Reid|S|NA|Democratic

10720010041947|Mr. President, last week I said to people in northern Minnesota--specifically northeast Minnesota on the Iron Range--that I thought we had a real breakthrough. I thought it was part of fast track on trade adjustment authority, including legacy costs, and a 1-year bridge where health care costs would be covered. Through no fault of any of the retirees, a lot of these companies, including LTV, declared bankruptcy and walked away from health care benefits, which is terrifying to people in their older age. Yesterday, the administration came out with a statement about this trade adjustment assistance package: There is a nightmare. I say to my colleague from Mississippi that this is an absolute nightmare for people on the range. The President talked about how concerned he is. But this is just a 1- year bridge to help pay for these retirees' health care costs until we put together a package that deals with the legacy costs for the future. The President crushed the hopes of people with this position that the White House has now taken. The President says: Look what I have done for the steel industry. He talks about section 201, but now there are 1,000 exceptions to the kind of trade relief we thought we were going to get through section 201. In Minnesota, we were concerned about what was happening to the taconite industry. We were talking about the unfair competition from semifinished slab steel. Basically, the administration came up with a tariff quota, and it was 7 million tons of slab steel a year, which is what is being dumped right now on the range. It didn't give us any relief whatsoever. But, most important of all, what is happening now with this statement of position by the administration is they are just walking away from dealing with the legacy costs. Jerry Fowler, who testified before the HELP committee a couple of weeks ago, president of Local 4108, talked about the pain on the range, and talked about all of these people. Gosh. You talk about what we say we believe in--people who have just worked their heads off all of their lives, taconite workers, helping to produce steel, which is so critical to our national security, and a part of all of our military efforts. People are really proud and are proud of their families. They are proud of the range. Through no fault of their own, 32 steel companies have declared bankruptcy, and then they walk away from these people. They say they can no longer cover their health care benefits, nor their retiree benefits. Many people are afraid of no longer having prescription drug coverage. People were really hopeful, and I was able to report last week, and I was proud. I thank Senators Rockefeller, Mikulski, Stabenow, Levin, and certainly my colleague Mark Dayton. We worked hard to have iron ore and taconite included. This was a pragmatic part of the trade adjustment assistance--only a 1-year bridge, but it was a start. It would give people some security, and it was the right thing to do. The President has talked about his concern for steelworkers. Over and over again, he professed his concern for steelworkers. Then, specifically, the administration opposes the Daschle substitute last- minute addition of health insurance assistance for steel retirees. We know there is going to be a point of order and a budget challenge on this amendment. I believe what the White House has now done is basically sealed its fate. We are not going to be able to have this bridge. We are not going to be able to have this assistance for people. I question this fast track for a lot of reasons, but, at the very minimum, when people are out of work through no fault of their own--or people work for an industry that has been besieged with unfair trade-- the only thing they are asking for is a bridge to make sure retirees don't lose their benefits. All of us have worked so hard together--Senator Specter and Senator DeWine--to get this done. Now the administration comes out yesterday and torpedoes the whole thing. Mr. President, are you for the taconite workers on the Iron Range? Are you for the steelworkers? You say you are. We will be back on this over and over again. But this is a huge blow for the Iron Range in Minnesota and for me as a Senator from Minnesota trying to do my best to represent people. Yesterday the President made it very clear that all of his talk about helping the hard-working men and women of the U.S. steel industry is just that--talk. His latest pronouncement is that steelworker retirees don't need the assistance this bill would have provided to help them for 1 year to pay for health insurance they are losing because their company has gone bankrupt. This is outrageous--these are hard-working, decent, compassionate men and women who have devoted their lives to the steel industry--an industry that is essential to our national security--and now they find themselves without health insurance they were promised in their retirement because their companies have gone bankrupt, they're out in the cold without the resources to pay for health insurance, and the President says, oh, no, they don't need the 1-year lifeline this bill offers. Frankly, President Bush talks about what he's done for the steel industry and for steel workers. But there is not a lot of substance there. First, we had a section 201 decision that is looking more and more cosmetic. It may have brought relief to some sections of the steel industry, except that now the administration is entertaining all sorts of exceptions--there are over 1,000 exceptions to the President's section 201 decision and Secretary O'Neill is reported as saying that ``a significant portion of them will be favorably decided.'' Then there is the fact that the decision did nothing to help Minnesota's Iron Range--nor the iron industry as a whole--deal with import surges of semi-finished slab steel. While the President imposed tariffs on every other product category for which the International Trade Commission had found injury, for steel slab he decided to impose ``tariff rate quotas.'' This brings us virtually no relief. Nearly 7 million tons of steel slab can continue to be dumped on our shores before any tariff is assessed. For folks on the Iron Range, the injury will continue. Then, the President in his section 201 decision--and subsequently-- has totally ducked the serious legacy cost problem that is suffocating the domestic steel industry. In the last 2 years, 32 U.S. steel companies have filed for bankruptcy, and these companies represent nearly 30 percent of our domestic steel making capacity. These failures weren't the fault of the workers at these companies. These failures resulted from unfair and predatory practices of our trading partners over an extended period. Yet despite the moral and economic imperative to do something about this legacy cost problem so that the steel industry, so essential to our national security, can rebuild and revitalize itself, the President has washed his hands of the matter. It is somebody else's problem he says. And now there is the current bill. Those of us who are serious about this legacy cost problem, and it is a bipartisan group, have introduced S. 2189, the Steel Industry Retiree Benefits Protection Act of 2002, to address the legacy cost question in a comprehensive way. In the meantime, however, recognizing that every day steelworker retirees whose companies are going bankrupt are losing their heath insurance, Senator Daschle introduced provisions to provide stop gap assistance-- 1 year of health insurance to retirees who right now are losing their benefits--to tide folks over while we work on the larger problem. And that, incredibly, is what President Bush yesterday announced his opposition to. It is now abundantly clear, if there had been any doubt, that this President is not interested in health and well-being of our steelworker families. In Minnesota, on the Iron Range, there are several thousand retirees who find themselves in desperate need of assistance and this administration is turning its back on them. Earlier this year, the HELP Committee held hearings on the need for legacy cost legislation both for retirees and for the industry. The testimony was riveting. The need compelling. My good friend, Jerry Fallos, president of Local 4108 of the United Steelworkers of America, testified at those hearings. The stories he had to tell were grim indeed. As Jerry said, the people of the Iron Range are used to hard times. They have weathered any number of challenges over the years. They are good people, proud, hard working--the best you can find anywhere. They are survivors--and they will get through these difficult times as well. They have given much to their country, and now they need our help. The good people of the range have responded to their country in its times of needs. Over the years our Nation's economy flourished and our manufacturing industries boomed from the iron ore produced through the labors of steelworkers on the range. Yesterday, when President Bush announced his opposition to helping these steelworker retirees he said it would cost too much. We think his $800 million estimate is way off, but even if you accept it at face value, it pales in comparison to the billions and billions of dollars of tax giveaways this administration is happy to make available to multinational corporations and the wealthy. We are talking about $120 billion over 10 years to make the estate tax permanent, and $400 billion over 10 years to make all of the tax cuts permanent. Are these our priorities--$400 billion to multinational corporations and wealthy individuals as opposed to $400 million to help steelworker retirees keep their health insurance for 1 year? I have asked many time before: Where are our priorities; where are our values? How can we tolerate such choices--tax breaks to help multinationals over health insurance for steelworker retirees? These families need our help. I urge my colleagues not to turn our backs on these men and women who have served their country so well.|107410|010320|91|Scr20mr01-129 1.txt|1559|1567|S2553-S2571|599|110|OR|Gordon Smith|S|NA|Republican

It is by no means a stretch to characterize the junta's mismanagement and oppression of the people of Burma as a ``reign of terror.'' I join my colleagues in both the Senate and House who have called for justice for these heinous crimes, and for continued pressure on the illegitimate regime in Burma to relinquish power to the sole legitimate representative of the people of Burma, the National League for Democracy.

10720010059094|Mr. President, born nearly a century ago, when Mark Twain was alive and Teddy Roosevelt was still President, Strom Thurmond has led a life of public service unmatched in the modern history of America. He has been a friend to all of the more than 400 Senators with whom he has served. And he will forever be a symbol of what one person can accomplish when they live life to the fullest. Strom Thurmond has served in the Senate for all but four of my 50 years of age. Though that is a remarkable accomplishment itself, we should not forget what Strom accomplished before coming to the Senate. He was a teacher, an athletic coach, and a Superintendent of Education. He studied law under his father, Judge J. William Thurmond and became a City Attorney, County Attorney, State Senator, and, eventually, a Circuit Court Judge. Though exempt from serving in the military, Strom, who had already been an army reservist and a commissioned 2nd Lieutenant by the age of 21, volunteered for active duty on the day we entered WWII. As a member of the 82nd Airborne, he parachuted behind enemy lines on D-Day and helped secure the foothold for the Allies to liberate the European continent. For his distinguished service, Strom was awarded five Battle Stars and 18 other decorations, including the Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star for Valor, the Belgian Order of the Crown and the French Cross of War. After the war, Strom returned home to South Carolina. He was elected Governor in 1946 and then ran for President of the United States as the States Rights Democratic candidate. Although Harry Truman prevailed, Strom won four states and 39 electoral votes. That tally still stands as the third largest independent electoral vote in U.S. history. Despite not winning the presidency, Strom was determined to serve in Washington. He ran for the Senate in 1954 and became the only candidate elected to Congress by a write-in vote in American history. Strom has been re-elected eight times since. Clearly the people of South Carolina value principle, character and courage in their leaders. Though it has been more difficult in recent years for Strom to make it home to South Carolina, that has not stopped South Carolina from coming to him. And it shouldn't. For decades Strom attended every county fair, handled every constituent request, and sent a congratulatory note to every high school graduate, many of whom came to intern in his office. It has been said that almost 70 percent of South Carolinians have met Strom Thurmond face-to-face. Over the course of his long and distinguished career, Strom Thurmond has been a witness to history. As a young man, he knew people who had seen Andrew Jackson, and he campaigned for the votes of men who fought in the Civil War. He and Herbert Hoover won their first elective office in the same year, 1928. But Strom has more than seen history; he has written it. Not only is he the oldest and long-serving Senator, he has served with about one- fifth of the nearly 2,000 people who have been members of the Senate since 1789. And he is nearly one half the age of the United States Constitution itself. Like the great experiment that is American democracy, Strom Thurmond has certainly faced his trials, both politically and personally. Yet, through it all, he has always held tight to his principles, always upheld his beliefs, and always defended American values at home and abroad. Today we say thanks to this giant of a man not only for the history he has witnessed and written, but for the service his life will inspire for generations to come. God bless our friend, our colleague, and the Senate's Icon of Time, the senior Senator from South Carolina, Strom Thurmond.|107900|010710|71|Scr10jy01-85 1.txt|1318|1318|S7363-S7374|21|4|NA|Speaker|NA|NA|N/A
10720010059645|Mr. President, I rise today to state my intention to vote in favor of a resolution to authorize the use of military force against Iraq. At this point, final resolution language is begin arrived at, and I believe this effort will lead to a resolution which will gain broad, bipartisan support. I support the President, and as a member of the Appropriations Committee, look forward to working with him to ensure that our Armed Forces remain the best-equipped, best-trained fighting force in the world. Simply put, the world would be a far safer place without Saddam Hussein. As long as he remains in power in Iraq, he will be a threat to the United States, to his neighbors, and to his own people. Over the past decade, he has systematically reneged on his commitments to the international community. He has refused to halt his weapons of mass destruction program, to renounce his support for international terrorism, and to stop threatening peace and stability in the region. The threat that Saddam Hussein continues to pose to our national security interests, and his failure to abide by previous United Nation's Security Council resolutions, provides sufficient justification should military action become necessary. I am pleased that President Bush has come to the Congress to ask for authorization for the use of force in Iraq, and that the White House is continuing to work with us to develop the appropriate language for a congressional resolution. It is important for the people's representatives in Congress to have the opportunity to fully debate and vote on a matter of this importance. I hope we will move to this vote in an expeditious manner. In addition, I back the administration's efforts to build support for our policy in Iraq with our allies and with the international community as a whole. Secretary of State Colin Powell has been particularly effective in making the case that Iraq has not complied with the relevant Security Council resolutions and that he remains a threat. Make no mistake, I believe the United States is within its rights to act alone militarily to protect our vital national security interests. I we are required by circumstances to act alone, I will support that decision. U.S. action should not be contingent upon the decisions made by other nations or organizations. My expectation, however, is that this resolution will strengthen the hand of the President at securing United Nations or other forms of international support and cooperation, and I encourage his on-going effort in that regard. I believe that there is value in building an international coalition of nations and in having the full support of our allies. International support brings practical benefits, such as basing rights for U.S. soldiers and equipment in the region and authorization to use the airspace of neighboring countries to execute military strikes against Iraq. In addition, international support will increase the likelihood of success for our long-term strategy in Iraq and for the ongoing war on global terrorism. I encourage the President to continue his efforts to build a strong coalition of nations to support our Iraq policy. Mr. President, this issue has particular significance for me--my son Brooks is on active duty in the Army and is a member of one of the three units that General Franks has identified as likely to prosecute this war. There is a strong possibility that I may be voting to send my own son into combat, and that give me special empathy for the families of other American servicemen and women whose own sons and daughters may also be sent to Iraq. Nevertheless, I am willing to cast this vote--one of the most important in my career both as a Senator and certainly as a father--because I recognize the threat that Saddam Hussein represents to world peace. It is my hope that we can move forward quickly, in a bipartisan manner, to approve a resolution that will give the President the authority he needs to defend our Nation.|107410|010712|21|Scr12jy01-122 1.txt|231|232|S7554-S7577|95|15|OR|Gordon Smith|S|NA|Republican

The Senator from Nevada would acknowledge a markup in the Finance Committee was important and essential to achieving the consensus that is so critical in passing any significant piece of legislation. In this instance, we are discussing a package that represents more than $400 billion over the next 10 years. Mr. President, I think everybody would agree the Finance Committee should have had the opportunity to consider that initiative. I cannot think of the last time that creating a new benefit, a new package, or a new program that represents close to $400 billion over the next 10 years, has not had the benefit of a markup in the committee--at least, if you are thinking about enhancing the ability to create the consensus for the final passage of that legislation. So the process was circumvented, for whatever reason, I do not know. But what I do know is what is possible today. I do know if we had the political will, we could resolve the few differences between the positions that were offered on the floor back in July that, regrettably, we didn't have the opportunity to amend or further amend. It was, again, as I said, up or down, either/or, all or nothing. Well, you cannot achieve cooperation and consensus on a major package of this kind without working through the various issues. So all I am asking is we have the opportunity to consider a prescription drug benefit in tandem with the Medicare provider give- back. If we have time to provide $43 billion in additional assistance to Medicare providers--and I would wholeheartedly support that, but I also would support providing prescription drug coverage to our Nation's seniors. How can we do one without the other? I have not heard an explanation I think would be acceptable to the senior citizens of this country. We didn't have time? Well, where have we been over the last 2 years? We didn't have time, Mr. President? I don't think that is acceptable. How does anybody go home and say to their constituents we didn't have time--especially because that has been the rationale given for the last 4 years: we will put it on to the next Congress. We are elected to do what is important here and now. That is our obligation. If we have to stay here day and night, through the weekend, what greater obligation do we have than to do what is important to the people we represent? This is an issue that has been acknowledged by both sides to be one of our top domestic priorities, and we are saying we don't have time. We don't have time in the committee. We didn't have time in the committee last July. We didn't have time in the committee last spring. We have not had time. When do we have time around here, Mr. President? When do we have time to do what is right in this institution? When do we have time? How do we do it? We had a tripartisan group from the Senate Finance Committee begin to work on this issue a year ago--I would say in June, and we announced our principles a year ago July--to avoid this type of political showdown, to avoid the all-or-nothing confrontation that seems to pervade this institution. Guess what. We are denied the ability to mark up this bill in the Senate Finance Committee. Well, I might be protesting too much, but, frankly, I think our Nation's seniors deserve better. I know they are protesting. Tell them we don't have time. Explain to them why we didn't have a markup in the committee that would have increased the likelihood of the passage of this legislation. Now we are hearing we should have this Medicare provider give-back. I endorse that, but I don't believe these are mutually exclusive issues. I want to make that clear. These are not mutually exclusive items. Obviously, AARP agrees because of the letter they sent to the legislative leadership, the committee leadership, and the ranking member of the Finance Committee, that you should not do one without the other. I am speaking on behalf of the seniors I represent in my State of Maine. They deserve better. I hope the Senator from Nevada will reconsider, so we have the ability here and now to consider the provider give-back benefit, and if the Senator indicates there is general unanimous agreement to provide that, then we can focus on the prescription drug benefit and on the few areas we have identified to be the issues in disagreement between what was offered by Senator Graham and the tripartisan package offered by the Senator from Iowa, Senator Breaux from Louisiana, Senator Jeffords from Vermont, and myself. We can do that. I hope I will hear that message today. Let's begin here and now.|107300|010802|28|Scr02au01-95 1.txt|422|423|S8678-S8691|62|10|NV|Harry Reid|S|NA|Democratic

10720010064197|Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my Colleague from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich, to introduce the Truth in Budgeting and Social Security Protection Act of 2002. This bill collects a variety of budget process ideas to help protect Social Security, promote balanced budgets, and improve government accounting practices. I hope that this effort will help spur greater debate and action to restore fiscal discipline. Our government's finances have taken a dire turn in the last year- and-a-half. While in January of last year the Congressional Budget Office projected that, in the fiscal year just ended, fiscal year 2002, the government would run a unified budget surplus of $313 billion, now it projects a unified budget deficit of $157 billion. And not counting Social Security surpluses, the picture is even worse. While in January of last year CBO projected that for fiscal year 2002, the government would run a surplus of $142 billion, without using Social Security surpluses, now it projects a deficit of $314 billion, not counting Social Security. We must stop running deficits because they cause the government to use the surpluses of the Social Security Trust Fund for other government purposes, rather than to pay down the debt and help our Nation prepare for the coming retirement of the Baby Boom generation. And we must stop running deficits because every dollar that we add to the Federal debt is another dollar that we are forcing our children to pay back in higher taxes or fewer government benefits. When the government in this generation chooses to spend on current consumption and to accumulate debt for our children's generation to pay, it does nothing less than rob our children of their own choices. We make our choices to spend on our wants, but we saddle them with debts that they must pay from their tax dollars and their hard work. And the government should not do that. That is why I am joining with my Colleague from Ohio to introduce this bill to improve the budget process today. We need to strengthen the budget process. We need to do more. Our bill would: extend the discretionary spending caps and the pay- as-you-go rules for 5 years, strengthen the enforcement of those budget rules, help protect Social Security surpluses, institute biennial budgeting, improve accounting for long-term costs of legislation, improve accounting for federal insurance programs, highlight the full expenses, including interest costs, of spending or tax cuts, and create a new commission to study the budget process. Together, these budget process proposals would go a long way toward increasing the responsibility of the Federal budget. I hope that between now and the beginning of the next Congress, my Colleagues and observers of the budget process will review these proposals, perhaps build on them, and then join with us in a major effort to strengthen the budget process next year. We must stop using Social Security surpluses to fund other government programs. We must stop piling up debt for our children to pay off. We must enact major reforms of the budget process. I hope that this effort will contribute to those ends. S. 3132. A bill to improve the economy and the quality of life for all citizens by authorizing funds for Federal-aid highways, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.

10720010067101|Mr. President, I want to express my support for this bill On balance, I believe it will greatly benefit our national defense and our country. Importantly, we have taken steps to increase pay and benefits for our men and women in uniform and reverse the neglect of our Armed Forces over the past decade. For this alone, the legislation is an important priority. Let me take a moment to highlight a few of the bill's other provisions that have special significance. First is the amendment I supported concerning the waiver authority for the 50/50 rule which governs outsourcing of maintenance depot work. The amendment moves waiver authority to the Secretary of Defense from the service secretaries. It also requires the Secretary to explain how he will meet the requirements if he requests a waiver. This is vitally important in order to maintain our depot infrastructure which is a crucial national asset. Also of great interest to our veterans is a provision in the bill that addresses the concurrent receipt problem. For too long, we have penalized our disabled military retirees by forcing them to give up their retirement in order to receive disability pay. Senator Reid's amendment fixes this by allowing our military retirees to receive both their retirement pay and their disability pay. The sacrifice of disabled veterans should not be diminished by this unfair penalty, and I am happy to have cosponsored Senator Reid's amendment which rectifies this inequity. I am also pleased that S. 1438 includes another provision which would address a gross inequity in the law. Currently, a retirement-eligible service member who dies in the line of duty is not considered vested in the military retirement program. The bill we are passing today will allow for the posthumous retirement of the member and thus provide additional benefits to the surviving spouse and children. The bill also includes an additional $5 million for consequence management training involving weapons of mass destruction. This will make use of the unique training capabilities that exist at Dugway Proving Ground in Utah. I think we will all agree this is very timely given the terrorist threats our nation is facing. I am committed to ensuring adequate resources are available to train units, civil support teams and other teams and individuals in combating terrorism. To that end, I support the bill's provision to require the Secretary of Defense to report back on the capabilities of defense installations, such as Fort Leonard Wood and Dugway Proving Ground, to train first responders. Along with the positive aspects of the bill, there are still provisions with which I disagree. First and foremost of these is the authorization for a round of base closures in 2003. This is simply not the moment to spend inordinate amounts of time and federal tax dollars preparing for base closings. The Nation's military bases and the military establishment need to be focused on the war effort. I hope that this unwise language will be dropped by the conferees. Additionally, I oppose the provision concerning the Federal Prison Industries. Any change to Federal Prison Industries should be part of a comprehensive overhaul rather than piecemeal changes in an unrelated bill. The ability to put prisoners to work greatly contributes to their rehabilitation. Without a market for the goods, an important tool is eliminated. Again, I am hopeful this provision will be dropped in conference. I was very disappointed, that the bill did not include the Service Members Protection Act. By prohibiting the Government from cooperating in any way with the International Criminal Court, this legislation would protect our service members from unjust and arbitrary prosecutions for carrying out policies of the United States Government. I will continue to work with Senator Helms, the author of the legislation, to secure its passage. Before closing, I also want to discuss Senator Domenici's amendment to make spending for the Radiation Exposure Compensation Trust Fund mandatory. I am heartened the amendment will be included in the bill we are about to pass. I strongly support this amendment and commend Senator Domenici on a job well done. Over the past months, Senator Domenici and I have worked together to make needed improvements to the RECA program. We have been joined in this effort by Majority Leader Tom Daschle and Senators Bingaman, Reid, Campbell, Wellstone and Johnson. I feel safe in speaking for all of us when I express the shock and outrage we felt upon learning that the RECA trust fund was empty and that our constituents were receiving IOUs for the compensation they deserved. We vowed to our constituents that we would work day and night to ensure that funding for RECA would be guaranteed, and when this amendment is enacted, that promise will be fulfilled for the next decade. As my colleagues are aware, earlier this year, I introduced legislation, S. 898, which includes language similar to the Domenici amendment. This language would also make spending for RECA mandatory, so that the appropriators would automatically fund the program each year. It will guarantee that all eligible individuals would receive their compensation in a timely manner. Despite all of our efforts, despite the RECA claimants' good faith, and despite the hard work of Justice Department officials administering the program, the Trust Fund became depleted in March of 2000. This situation was simply unacceptable. RECA claimants began receiving ``IOU'' letters from the Federal Government in lieu of checks until we approved this year's supplemental appropriations bill, which covered the past IOUs and all claims approved as of September 30, 2001. However, many new claims will be approved in the coming years and, therefore, it is imperative that spending for this program become mandatory. And while these mandatory funds will provide a substantial amount of money to the RECA trust fund from fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year 2011, it is important to know that this will not completely solve our constituents' concerns, we will still need more Federal money to provide compensation to all RECA victims. Let me assure these individuals, especially my fellow Utahns, that I will continue to fight this battle until all individuals are compensated by the Federal Government. On a whole, this is a very good bill crafted by very good lawmakers. It begins to provide the Defense Department with adequate resources after 10 years of erosion. However, this is only the first installment; there is yet much to be done. I hope to work with my colleagues in the days and months ahead to ensure that we strengthen our defense posture as quickly and as effectively as possible.|107500|011002|41|Scr02oc01-169 1.txt|1334|1441|S10043-S10055|6738|1097|UT|Orrin Hatch|S|NA|Republican

10720010067639|Mr. President, I will not speak much longer. Let me say to the whip--who, by the way, also was a member of the Capitol Police, the only one in the Senate--I thank him. I don't even want to make a big deal of this. In fact, I am almost embarrassed about it. This now is going to become a point of contention? I am a pretty good rabble-rouser. I didn't think this would be something on which we would have to go this far. My hope is that it will pass. I say to the whip that I would like to get his help, that if this doesn't clear today, then I will prepare an amendment. I would love to have the whip's support and do it with him. We will just come out here and have a debate, I suppose, if Senators are opposed to the resolution of support. Above and beyond that, we are talking about a lot of Capitol Police. They are working 6 days a week, 12 hours a day. Frankly, the whip discussed this with me. Above and beyond just the resolution saying ``thank you for your support,'' the other point is the additional resources. With all due respect, there will have to be additional resources to go to them for them to be able to do this job. I thought when I came back that this resolution would have been passed. I wouldn't have thought there would have been any controversy. I thought we then could notify the police. Now what we will do is talk about it for a day or so. We will keep asking who is holding it up. We will keep asking why. It is hardly a way to say thank you to the police. And if necessary, we will have an amendment on it.|107269|011009|7|Scr09oc01-104 1.txt|136|160|S10354-S10355|1537|305|MN|Paul Wellstone|S|NA|Democratic

10720010072565|Madam President, I have listened closely to some aspects of this debate, especially the amendment presently pending, raised by my distinguished colleague from my neighboring State of New Hampshire. I had the honor of serving for 8 years on the Senate Intelligence Committee, where I was vice chairman. I have enormous regard for the current chairman and vice chairman of the committee. I have also served as both ranking member and chairman of the Judiciary Committee. As I listened to the debate, something sounded familiar. Indeed, this amendment was raised during the debate in preparation of the antiterrorism bill that the Congress passed and the President signed last month. There was no enthusiasm for it from Republicans or Democrats. We looked at it, the White House looked at it, and the Justice Department looked at it. None of us were interested in including it in what became the USA Patriot Act. The idea of having a quasi-secret court, and making only limited evidence available to the defendant, as is true under existing law, is constitutionally questionable enough. But to say that we will not tell the defendant any of the evidence against him in the court, as Senator Smith proposes, is the kind of thing we rail against when other countries do it. Our government officials have gone all the way to the head of state level to register complaints when Americans have been held in other countries without being informed of the charges against them. Every President I have known has been forced at one time or another to raise such issues with another head of state. We should not make this task more difficult by approving of the amendment Senator Smith has offered here. Let us look at a little bit of history. The Alien Terrorist Removal Court was created in 1996. It was done largely through the efforts of Senators Hatch and Dole. It exists to provide a way for the Government to remove terrorist aliens whom it believes it cannot attempt to remove through public hearings, to balance the Government's need to maintain its existing intelligence sources while giving some rights to the accused. Under the law as it presently exists, the accused does not see the actual evidence against him but does receive an unclassified summary of that evidence. The law states very clearly that that unclassified summary has to be ``sufficient to enable the alien to prepare a defense.'' Under the amendment that Senator Smith has presented, an alien accused of being a terrorist would receive no information about the basis of the charges against him, not even the limited summary provided in existing law. If we were to pass something of this nature, there is no way the President of the United States or the Secretary of State or the Attorney General could go to any other country holding an American on undisclosed evidence and demand to see that evidence. That nation could simply say that it is doing what the United States, the country seen as the bulwark of freedom, is doing, the United States that has had a written Constitution that has survived for all these years. The U.S. Constitution, as written and interpreted over the last two centuries, makes it clear that the government cannot bring somebody into a court and say: ``We have all this information against you, but we are not going to tell you what it is. Are you guilty of what we have against you? I am not going to tell you what it is we have against you, but I want to know, are you guilty or not? And, if you are not guilty, then defend yourself against these charges we have brought. Sorry, you can't see the charges. Sorry, you can't hear the evidence. Sorry, we can't let you know what is going on. But we will give you a chance to defend yourself.'' It doesn't quite work that way. Anybody in this body who has been either a prosecutor or defense attorney, on either side, would not want that. The distinguished Presiding Officer knows as well as any Senator here the terrible nature of September 11. Her State was impacted in a horrible way, as were the surrounding States of New Jersey and Connecticut, just as the State of Virginia has been horribly harmed by the attack on the Pentagon. Nobody has stated the horror, the anger, and the feelings left in the wake of the September 11 attacks in a more articulate way than the distinguished Presiding Officer. We all share those feelings. But nobody here has ever suggested that we somehow abandon all our laws, all our rules, our Constitution and everything we stand for, the very democracy that got the terrorists to attack us. In effect, we would say, ``We surrender.'' The Senator from New York, the Senator from Vermont, the Senator from Florida, all 100 of us--none of us is about to surrender. We understand there is a problem with terrorism. I suspect throughout my lifetime we will face threats. But let's answer the threats in the ways that comport with what our constitutional history and our history as a nation. The Alien Terrorist Removal Court has not been used, but that is not because an unclassified summary has to be provided to the defendant. The Justice Department talked to us about why the court is not being used, and did not mention this. When the Department was given the opportunity to consider this amendment at the time of the terrorism bill, it did not want it. I suspect that this lack of interest is related to concerns within the Justice Department about constitutional challenges to the court itself, as it is formulated under existing law. Surely the Justice Department knows that if we approve this amendment those constitutional challenges will basically be irrefutable. We provide substantial new powers to the Justice Department with regard to terrorist aliens through the antiterrorism legislation we just passed, legislation I voted for, the distinguished senior Senator from Florida voted for, his colleague, the other Senator from Florida voted for; the distinguished Presiding Officer voted for it--98 of us voted for it. That legislation should make it easier for the Justice Department to use this court. But as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I could never support this amendment, which has already been rejected once by the administration and by Republicans and Democrats who negotiated the antiterrorism bill. I certainly could not accept it absent any showing of why it is needed. I say to my friend from Florida, the distinguished chairman, that I have no problem calling upon the administration to notify the Judiciary Committee if it really believes a change in the law is needed. The administration did not believe this a couple of weeks ago. But if the Attorney General now believes he needs something such as this, I will be glad to hold hearings on the issue and bring his concerns forward. But to do something of such constitutional magnitude in an amendment on the floor, without any hearings in the Judiciary Committee or Intelligence Committee, is simply inappropriate. Madam President, we need to go back to basic constitutional law 101 here. The idea of giving the government the ability to bring removal proceedings against someone and force him to defend himself without telling him of the evidence against him flies in the face of all of our principles. We must not tell the rest of the world that the only way we can defend ourselves is to accuse somebody but not tell him what the evidence is against him. Back in the 1700s, we fought a revolution to ensure a much different principle. All of us share the terror of what happened. All of us are opposed to terrorists. All of us want to defend the United States. But we must not let our enthusiasm to defend our Nation lead us to do things that will hurt us further. Frankly, I would be delighted to have the Attorney General take a look at Senator Smith's amendment and see what he thinks. But I tell my friend from Florida that I certainly do not support this amendment, because the constitutional questions raised are of such enormous magnitude. To do so without any request from the administration and without any hearings would not be a responsible action for this body to take. I yield the floor.|107503|011108|48|Scr08no01-138 1.txt|2109|2238|S11568-S11584|8161|1406|VT|Patrick Leahy|S|NA|Democratic

10720020010925|Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues who remain awake at 3 o'clock this morning, and for the folks who work for this House, I very much apologize for you keeping awake 5 minutes longer, but I do think that this House has hit what could possibly be the lowest low it has ever hit. Two weeks ago, the House that claims to be for national security refused to give this Member a vote on whether or not we would prevent another round of base closures, because I think that is incredibly stupid and a waste of money. But what is so much worse than that is that, without an up-or-down vote, without having the guts, the courage, the fortitude, and may I say the honesty to say that you are increasing the debt limit by $750 billion, the House just voted to do so. You wrapped it in a package that would help the troops to the tune of $21 billion, but what you really have done is increased the debt limit and put our Nation another $750 billion in debt. Let me tell you why I think that is bad. As of the end of last month, our Nation was $5,984,677,357,213.86 in debt. Sometimes that is just mind-boggling. But let us bring it back to reality. Let us bring it back to one lifetime. Let us bring it back to my daughter Sarah's lifetime. On the day she was born on Christmas, 1978, our Nation was less than $1 trillion in debt. We had gone through the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. We built the interstate highway system, St. Lawrence Seaway. We have done so many good things for the citizens, and we managed to do it and borrow less than $1 trillion. In 1980 Ronald Reagan became President, made the promise that we could somehow cut taxes and increase spending and it is all going to work, in a Democratic House, but a Republican Senate, a Republican President. At the end of those 8 years, he had doubled the national debt to $2 trillion. That is a fact. And he never lost a veto vote. If he thought it was that bad a deal, he could have vetoed those bills and he would have won, but he did not, and that is a fact. So what we have now 22 years later is $5 trillion more debt. What is really bad about that debt is folks back home, when you tell them, they say, where does my tax money go? They think it goes to food stamps or they think it goes to welfare, and they are absolutely appalled when we tell them it is squandered on interest on the national debt, $1 billion a day. It does not educate a kid, it does not defend the country, it does not pave a highway. It is just squandered, and a third of that money goes to German and Japanese lending institutions. Mr. Speaker, $100 billion a year leaves this country in interest payments to German and Japanese lending institutions. So where does it stop? I believed you guys. I really did. I believed the Republicans when they said give us a chance to govern and we will balance the budget, but you lied to me. You were given a chance to govern, and you balanced the budget for 1 year and then you went crazy on tax breaks, because that is where the campaign contributions are. That is what it is all about. Have the honesty to admit it. You passed a so-called death tax repeal because that is where the campaign contributions are. So you reduced revenues, you increased spending, and you are somehow surprised that in 12 months you have increased the national debt by $323,329,559,211.21. And what makes me mad, this son of a television salesman, is that my kids have to pay that bill. I do not like you sticking my kids with your bills. I am for the troops. I did not ask for the Committee on Armed Services; I begged for it. I chose that committee because that is the best way I can serve them. But the best way I can serve those kids in Afghanistan is not asking them to serve their country and then sticking them for the bill for this war when they get home and their kids with this bill for the rest of their lives.|107274|020524|2|Hcr24my02-130 1.txt|18|79|H3070|4001|762|MS|Gene Taylor|H|5|Democratic
10720020014100|Mr. Speaker, get the senior tour buses gassed up to travel to Canada, because under the Republican prescription drug plan seniors will not find any relief from the high costs of prescription drugs. In fact, Americans pay three to four times more for their medications than any other people in the world; and the prices of the 50 most commonly prescribed drugs for seniors increased last year nearly three times the rates of inflation. Yet the Republican bill does not do one thing to reduce the root cause of our Nation's crisis in access to affordable life-saving medications and that is their costs. Under the Republican plan, seniors would be forced to purchase drugs through private drug policies, another slippery slope to the dangerous path to privatization. And as if attempting to privatize Medicare were not enough, the Republican bill covers less than a quarter of Medicare beneficiaries' estimated drug costs over the next 10 years. Frankly, the Republican bill preserves the inflated prices of one of their biggest set of contributors. It is no wonder the pharmaceutical companies showed up in droves last week at the Republican party's $30 million fund raising bash here in Washington. In fact, Bob Novak from CNN gave us insight into that fund-raiser. He said, ``This is one of the great fund-raisers of all time, because people going to see these things for 20 years had never found them so crowded. It was chair to chair, back to back.'' And they had to pay $100,000 to get into the photo session with the President. If you wanted to sit on the platform with the President, that cost a little more. You had to pay $250,000 in order to do that. I guess they will try to get the government they are paying for unless the American people pay attention. Now with all the high rhetoric surrounding the Republican plan one might think it provides a real benefit, but take a closer look. Under the Republican plan you may, and I stress may, be able to choose from a private program that will cost you $35 a month. Yes, their bill does not cap the drug premium. In fact, insurers would set the premium cost, and it would vary from plan to plan, place to place. But let us ignore that flaw for a moment and assume it might be about $35 a month. So that is $420 a year for that premium. For the first $250 you spend on prescription medication, this new plan will pay you exactly nothing. That is right. If you need no more than $250 worth of medication, this plan will cost you $670 a year, the $35 monthly premium plus the $250 deductible. Now if you are one of every three Medicare beneficiaries who spend less than $500 on medication every year, you are in for a treat. What would have cost you $500 will cost you $720 under the Republican plan. Yes, you would actually pay almost 50 percent more under their plan than you would pay without it. Maybe a person spends closer to $1,000 a year, as half of the Medicare population does. If so, they do fare a bit better. If their medications will cost $1,000, they will spend $420 on the program, $250 for the first batch of drugs and then 20 percent of the next $750 they owe, or $150. That adds up to $820. They will have saved $160. But if someone is among the 30 percent of Medicare recipients that spends more than $2,000 a year for drugs, I am afraid we have some bad news for them. Under the Republican plan, they are on their own for every dollar between $2,000 and $3,800. This plan will not pay them a cent. Their plan is simply a sad attempt to gain political cover by sounding like they are working for and care about seniors while simultaneously draining Social Security and Medicare trust funds to pay for huge breaks for the superrich contributors. So ignore the Republican rhetoric. We should provide seniors with a real and meaningful prescription drug benefit. We should encourage aggregate buying by groups of seniors, not sending each senior out there with some kind of expensive privatized plan in the rough waters of the marketplace in their very, very small canoes. The first step to make Medicare and prescription medication available to our seniors at more affordable prices and to make them more available is to vote ``no'' on the risky Republican Medicare drug plan they intend to bring up this week.|107383|020625|2|Hcr25jn02-114 1.txt|18|87|H3918-H3919|4282|764|OH|Marcy Kaptur|H|9|Democratic

10720020015423|Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule that would not allow a Democratic substitute and to the underlying bill. I rise against the rule and the Republican bill. I regret for America's seniors that a Democratic alternative was not allowed. Medicare provides health care coverage to forty million retired and disabled Americans. For decades, Medicare has worked to provide needed, lifesaving health care to millions, but it is missing a fundamental component: a prescription drug benefit. If we have courage, this Congress can make history and give our nation's seniors what they desperately need: a real, and meaningful prescription drug plan. I am proud to join my Democratic colleagues, led by Mr. Dingell, Mr. Rangel, Mr. Stark, and Mr. Brown, as an original cosponsor of H.R. 5019, the ``Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit and Discount Act.'' I come to the floor to discuss two points: Number 1: unlike the Republican drug plan, the Democratic plan is simple because it builds upon a proven model--Medicare. Just like seniors pay a Part B premium today for doctor visits, under our plan, seniors would pay a voluntary Part D premium of $25 per month for drug coverage. For that, Medicare or the government will pay 80 percent of drug costs after a $100 deductible. And no senior will have to pay more than $2,000 in costs per year. There is an urgent need for this plan. The most recent data indicates that almost 40 percent of seniors--an estimated 11 milion--have no drug coverage. Problems are particularly acute for low income seniors and seniors over the age of 85 . Additionally, those older Americans who do have coverage find that their coverage is often inadequate for their needs. The Democratic plan is a real plan with real numbers, not estimates. Point 2: the Republican plan does nothing to bring down the cost of prescription drugs. The Democratic plan is the only plan that provides real Medicare prescription drug coverage for our seniors by stopping soaring drug costs. Under the buying power of Medicare, through competition and bargaining we can rein in drug costs. Prescription drug costs are too high for our older Americans. They need help now! For instance, let's look at the cost of Prevacid. Prevacid is an ulcer medication, and the second most widely used drug by American seniors. The cost for this prescription is on average $137.54 per month in New York City--but only $45.02 in the United Kingdom, a price differential of 206 percent. Or look at Celebrex, a popular arthritis medication and a drug needed by many older women, especially, since older women are stricken more often than men by arthritis. According to a Government Reform Committee report released by Mr. Weiner and myself, a monthly supply of this drug costs $86.26 in New York City. In France, a monthly supply of Celebrex costs only $30.60. This is a price differential of 182 percent. Seniors in New York City without drug coverage must pay almost three times as much as purchasers in France. Prices for prescriptions have risen 10 percent per year for the last several years, leading to over $37 billion in profits last year for the giant drug companies. While these corporations wallow in their spoils, seniors suffer without coverage. Mr. Speaker, we must pass the Democratic prescription drug plan without delay. It is built on a proven model, Medicare. The Republican plan only offers gap-ridden coverage. The Republican bill is about privatization. The Republican plan is all about election year politics. For the sake of our seniors, we must pass the Democratic plan, and we must pass it now.|107338|020627|81|Hcr27jn02pt2-19 1.txt|1008|1068|H4166-H4216|3609|604|NY|Carolyn Maloney|H|14|Democratic
10720020018094|Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New Mexico for all the gentleman has done over the years. But despite how much I like the gentleman from New Mexico, what an embarrassment. Once again, the House of Representatives is considering a Department of Interior appropriations bill that does not sufficiently fund the arts and the humanities. Funding for the National Endowment for the Arts was cut dramatically in 1995 by more than 40 percent, and it has never returned to adequacy. Shame on us. Opponents of this amendment call for fiscal discipline, as if the richest Nation in the world needs to be culturally impoverished. Shame on us. We all know that it is not the lack of money that keeps funding for the NEA and the NEH so low, because the funding we invest provides a huge economic return on our Federal investment, both in dollars and in jobs. According to a recent study by Americans for the Arts, the nonprofit arts industry generates $134 billion in economic activity every year, creating more than 4 million jobs. The arts industry is a money maker, not a money taker. Another study, this one by the Arts Education Partnership, provides hard evidence that children who participate in the arts improve their critical learning skills in math, reading, language development, and writing. In addition, NEA funds programs like Positive Alternatives for Youth, which lowers the rate of juvenile crime by creating artist-led after-school programs for our youth. When we deprive the NEA or the NEH of needed funds, we deprive this entire Nation of an active cultural community. It is a battle that has been going on since the stockades were used to control creativity in Puritan times, and it is absolutely wrong-headed. The arts teaches us to think, encourages us to feel and see and to look in different ways. This is a good amendment, and it must be passed.|107034|020717|247|Hcr17jy02-59 1.txt|3111|3142|H4773-H4819|1867|319|CA|Lynn Woolsey|H|6|Democratic

10720020022957|Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 435, which does express the sense of the Congress that the therapeutic technique known as rebirthing is a dangerous and harmful practice that should be prohibited. Now, Mr. Speaker, a terrible story: in Colorado, a 10-year-old girl named Candace Newmaker died during a rebirthing session. Rebirthing is supposed to forge new bonds between adoptive parents and their children, and it involves wrapping the child in a sheet and covering him or her with pillows, often for more than an hour, to simulate the birthing process. During the procedure, Candace, who had been diagnosed with attachment disorder, told her therapist several times that she could not breathe. However, her therapist did not unwrap her, but told her to push harder to get out. Candace was rushed to a local hospital where she died the next day. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, Candace is not the only child to die and suffer from this practice. Four other children have died as a result of rebirthing therapy. The American Psychological Association does not recognize rebirthing as proper treatment for attachment disorders, and many States, including Colorado, have enacted legislation which makes it illegal to practice rebirthing therapy if restraints are involved or there is a risk of physical injury. Many other States have enacted or are considering legislation to prohibit this technique, as well. The Committee on Energy and Commerce unanimously approved the resolution before us on September 5; and we are very, very grateful to the gentlewoman from North Carolina for introducing this resolution. It does encourage each State to enact a law that prohibits this potentially very deadly practice. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.|107111|020917|5|Hcr17se02-94 1.txt|61|93|H6268-H6269|1905|307|FL|Michael Bilirakis|H|9|Republican
10720020024381|Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4600 Like my colleagues, I am concerned about medical malpractice premiums and their effect on the availability of physicians, especially obstetricians and specialty physicians to practice in certain states. I am not at this time convinced, however, that H.R. 4600 is the complete answer to the medical malpractice insurance premium problem. The concentration of excessively high premiums in certain states shows that this is a regional, not national problems. I believe that Congress should address the medical malpractice insurance system as a whole. The pricing and accounting practices of medical malpractice insurers may have contributed to this problem. There are indications that imprecise accounting practices have inflated the bottom line of companies and price wars in the early 1990s led insurers to sell malpractice coverage at rates that were inadequate to cover anticipated claims. Recent stock market declines have further exacerbated the financial difficulties of these companies, which have raised premiums or gone out of business in response. I believe that a solution to the problem of rapidly rising medical malpractice insurance premiums must address all of the factors that contribute to premium cost. Earlier this year, I sent a letter with several of my colleagues asking that the General Accounting Office conduct a study on the effect of market conditions and insurance company practices on medical malpractice insurance premiums. I am introducing into the Record a copy of that letter as well as a July 3, 2002, article from the Wall Street Journal. I expect to have preliminary results from the GAO in December. Once we know the full scope of the problem, I hope that we can work together to find a comprehensive solution to this problem.|107193|020926|128|Hcr26se02-88 1.txt|5643|5727|H6705-H6743|1808|287|KS|Dennis Moore|H|3|Democratic

10720020029487|Mr. President, I listened with interest today to my colleague from Arizona, and now my colleague from Minnesota, on this subject of economic recovery. This is a critically important subject. This is not the normal run-of-the-mill policy that we debate here in the Senate. Our economy is in some trouble, and I am not sure any of us quite understand how much trouble. It is a new economy. We don't have models by which we can judge what happened in the past and therefore project what might happen in the future. This is a new global economy that operates and behaves in ways that are different than perhaps represent our conventional understanding. I know my friend from Minnesota mentioned that our colleague from Texas, who is in the Chamber, came from a background of teaching economics, I believe, in college. I, too, briefly taught economics in college. I like to say that I have gone on, nonetheless, to overcome that experience and lead a reasonably productive life. The field of economics is not much more than psychology pumped up with a little helium. We have all kinds of economists in this country who will give us their best guess of what has happened and what will happen. But nobody really knows. We have heard suggestions from respected economists in America, Nobel Prize winners no less, that we have an economy that is in a recession; that we have rather substantial overcapacity in this economy, and the most effective way to jumpstart this economy is to do the kinds of things that represent a boost in consumption. This morning, one of my colleagues talked about increasing business investments. Perhaps there is a need for some of that. But most economist will tell you that during a time of recession, when you have overcapacity, the quickest way to jumpstart an economy is to boost consumption. What menu of plans has been introduced that would do that? One of my concerns is that there is almost no room to be critical of a plan these days because if you are critical, somehow you are taking on the President in an unfair way. I gave the response to the President's radio address a couple weeks ago, and I received a letter from a guy who said he was listening and almost drove off the road when he heard me. It was a shrill, partisan letter. Some of us receive those periodically. My response to the radio address--about the first one-third of it was about what a outstanding job this President has done prosecuting the war against terrorism. I complimented him and Secretary Powell and Secretary Rumsfeld and others. I talked at great length about that. Then I said, on the subject of economic recovery, that we have differences. I talked about those differences. I debated the differences in policy. Norman Vincent Peale once said: Most people would rather be ruined by praise than saved by criticism. There is nothing, in my judgment, that injures this country by having a full-scale debate break out on something that represents important public policy. Let me talk a bit about some of the ideas that have been brought forward on the subject of economic recovery. In my judgment, the goofiest idea, if I can use that term, came from the House Ways and Means Committee. We just had a colleague suggest that we start with that bill here on the floor of the Senate. The proposition is that we go back to 1988 and provide tax rebates to large corporations for the alternative minimum taxes they paid over the last 14 years. Somehow that is represented to be a piece of economic recovery policy. That is not going to promote economic recovery. It doesn't have the foggiest thing to do with economic recovery. It has everything to do with writing a very big check to some of the biggest corporations in this country. They paid tax under what is called a ``minimum tax'' because in the 1980s we decided we didn't want to have companies making billions of dollars in net profit and paying zero in taxes. We thought there ought to be some minimum at least. That was the proposition. But, of course, the House Ways and Means Committee, on which I used to serve, wrote a bill that said, by the way, let's provide rebate checks to all those companies that had to pay minimum taxes dating back to 1988, such as IBM. We will give them a $1.4 billion check. Ford Motor Company--give them a billion-dollar check. Does anybody think that will promote economic recovery in this country, when we are in a recession and have overcapacity in the economy. No, that is just a giveaway. I will not apologize to anybody for having passion about public policy and saying, when somebody recommends doing something that will increase the deficit, that augurs against the interests of the average American citizen and will do nothing to help the economic recovery but will enrich those who don't deserve that by giving them rebates for taxes they should have paid-- minimum taxes, not regular taxes. Nobody deserves an apology from those of us who say that makes no sense; that won't help this country. So we have a debate about those kinds of policies. I use that just as one example. My colleague, the majority leader, said let's take those areas of intersection between what the President and others have proposed, and where there is common ground, let's offer that, have amendments to it, and pass it. One area is extended unemployment benefits to those who have lost their jobs. Two months in a row, we have had news that 400,000 American people have lost their jobs. So 400,000 additional Americans came home from work one night and had to tell their families that they got a notice that they had lost their jobs. Do you know who most of them are? Most of them are families who know about second shifts, second jobs, secondhand, and second mortgages. These are the families at the bottom of the economic ladder, and they know about these things. They are the first to lose jobs in a recession. Now, we asked 11 of the leading economists in this country what we could do to give this economy a boost, what would really promote economic recovery. Virtually every single one of them said this: If you extend unemployment benefits to those who have lost their jobs during an economic downturn, that money is immediately spent by those who receive it because they need it. They need a helping hand during tough times. When they are down and out, they need a hand. They will spend that money immediately. That is exactly the kind of help that stimulates the economy. That is what we have done in every economic downturn in the last 25 years. So that is a provision the majority leader brings to the floor today that says: Look, the President says he supports that; we support that. Let's take that provision and pass that provision. Three additional provisions represent the same approach--common provisions agreed to by virtually everyone. He says let's move that which we can move, allow people to offer amendments to it, but let's not drag our feet any longer on these issues. Let's have some movement and action to try to give the economy a lift, with policies that we know and which economists tell us will help this economy recover. We talked a great deal in this Chamber about policies in kind of an antiseptic way. There is not much about real people and the effect of policies on real people. Just take one of those 400,000 people who, in October, had to tell their family they had lost their job, or one of those 400,000 people, in November, who had to tell their family: I have lost my job, but it wasn't my fault. This economy is in a recession. It was in a recession prior to September 11, and then those two airplanes that ran into that World Trade Center and murdered thousands of innocent Americans. That act of terror and mass murder cut a hole in this country's belly and created additional victims. They are people who lost their jobs because this economy continued to slow down even more following those terrorist attacks. So those people came home at night to say to their families: I have lost my job, my ability to make a living. It is said that the unemployment rate is 5.8 percent. For someone who goes home having to tell their family they have lost their ability to make a living, their unemployment statistic is 100 percent. They have lost their job. That is pretty tragic for families to have to explain to others that they no longer have a paycheck coming in. In most case, these are hard-working Americans. They are at the bottom of the economic ladder, scratching and clawing and trying very hard to move up and do well for their families. In a recession, in an economy that turns sour, it almost always injures them first. That is why this provision at the very least ought to be embraced by everyone immediately. Mr. President, I will make one additional comment. If politics was hot air, there would be enough to lift this building. I understand all that. But, frankly, on both sides of the aisle, we have men and women of good faith who really want to do the right thing. Let's try to find a key today to unlock this and find a way for Democrats and Republicans, conservatives, liberals, and moderates to understand that we all live in the same country. We all live on this same spaceship Earth. We are all Americans, and we want what is best for our country. It is not disloyal to break out in open debate about one policy or another, but at the end of the day, we must compromise. We must find a way to reach common agreement in ways that will help the American economy. I hope that is the case. Let me finish as I started. I think this President deserves the praise of the American people and this Congress for many things in recent months. I think the leaders of this Congress--my colleagues, Senator Daschle and Senator Lott--deserve praise in many ways for a lot of the things they have done to bring us together to deal with the threat to our country. I want to provide the same kind of praise to all of us for coming together--the President, yes, Senator Lott and Senator Daschle--to reach agreement now on an economic recovery package. What the majority leader has proposed makes good sense to me. He said we have all kinds of plans out there. Let's take that area where those plans intersect and we have reasonably common agreement. Let us move those and then come back and see if we can reach agreement on others, or take those areas of common agreement, offer some amendments to them, and see where the votes are and then move forward. What the majority leader has proposed makes good sense. I hope others will embrace it today. In the end, I am not interested in what is good for the Republican or the Democratic Party or the President or Congress. There is not a Republican or a Democratic way to go broke. There is not a Republican or Democratic way to lose your job. It is not a partisan thing to have to tell your family that you lost your job yesterday. This is not about politics. It is about whether we are going to do the right thing for the American people. Yes, for businesses, many of which are struggling, and especially for families, many of whom have received the news of a job being lost in an economy that has turned sour. What can we do to help this economy? A lot of the problems of this country we have talked about in recent days will be solved by a growing economy that provides opportunity and hope once again to families, to workers, and to businesses. It is interesting, there is one story going around about a corporation that failed in this country. That is a tragedy as well. But it is always the case when we see these situations, somehow those at the top end up doing real well and those at the bottom end up losing their shirts. In many cases, that is what happens in a recession as well. I hope we can understand that as we grapple with the questions of how do we pass legislation that gives this country's economy a chance to survive and how do we give American families and businesses some hope that tomorrow will be a better day, that they understand the American economy will offer opportunities for them again in the future.

10720020030192|Mr. President, today I want to honor the commanding officer at Ellsworth Air Force Base--who has just returned home after directing Air Force operations over Afghanistan and who will become a brigadier general this week. This outstanding officer, Colonel Edward A. Rice, Jr., has demonstrated his leadership abilities in a number of settings, and my fellow Senators can expect to hear more of him as he assumes new roles and responsibilities in our nation's service. As commander of the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing, Colonel Rice directed the main Air Force combat group operating over Afghanistan from late September until mid-January. This force of 1,800 personnel and 30 planes , delivered most of the ordnance that was so effective in shattering the Taliban and al Qaeda forces. All branches of the military played a role in this first victory in the war against terrorism, but as an Air Force veteran and a South Dakotan, I am particularly proud of the achievements of Colonel Rice and the forces under his command. Our experience in Afghanistan extends a military trend that began in our war against Iraq--the unprecedented ability of modern air power to achieve strategic objectives. Clearly our planes and munitions were markedly more precise, quicker to hit emerging targets, and generally more effective than the Soviet forces of the 1980s. A recent book labeled this trend ``The Transformation of American Air Power,'' and I believe Afghanistan will become the most recent example, joining the impressive results of the Gulf War, Kosovo, and our other Balkan campaigns. In addition, the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing broke new ground in several areas. Its bombers were the first to deliver our near-precision munitions in combat. These use navigational signals from GPS satellites to locate targets. They are much cheaper than laser-guided ``precision'' munitions and are not hampered by low-visibility weather conditions. Also, in coordination with ground spotters, the bombers were able to use advanced communications to reduce dramatically the time from target identification to target strike. Despite its controversial and troubled early years, I am also pleased that the B-1 continues its strong combat performance that began during Operation Desert Fox over Iraq and extended into the war in Kosovo. Its range and expansive bomb bays allowed it to make a round trip of nearly 6,000 miles, and also loiter over the battlefield with a variety of munitions, waiting for targets to emerge. Throughout this demanding, round-the-clock operation, Colonel Rice reports, B-1 made all scheduled takeoffs, released all weapons successfully, and delivered ordnance with excellent accuracy. Colonel Rice returned home from this mission about two weeks ago, just in time to be promoted to brigadier general. The Senate confirmed his nomination on September 26, 2001, and the pinning ceremony occurs Friday, February 1, at Ellsworth Air Force Base. Since arriving at Ellsworth in May 2000, Colonel Rice's performance has been impressive, and I know that as a general, he will be a tremendous asset for the Air Force. During Rice's tenure, Ellsworth has dramatically improved its maintenance performance, chalked up impressive results in its 2001 Operational Readiness Inspection, and moved to the front of the pack in Air Combat Command assessments of command, control and communication; bomb removal; and response to nuclear-biological-chemical hazards. The men and women of Ellsworth have also benefitted from the dedicated service of Colonel Rice's wife, Teresa. When base personnel deployed for the war against terrorism. Teresa co-hosted a series of town-hall meetings with the acting base commander to update spouses and families on the status of their loved ones and to educate them on the role their family was playing to make America safe. In less stressful times, she volunteers twice a week in the base thrift shop, has been active in the Officer Spouses Club, and has organized and attended holiday parties, retirement ceremonies, promotion celebrations and farewells--too many to count. In closing, Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to welcome Colonel Rice back home to Ellsworth after the successful execution of his mission in Operation enduring Freedom. His remaining time in South Dakota grows short, but I know I speak for many South Dakotans when I say it has been an honor to work with him and Teresa and to call them neighbors. They are a credit to their country, and we wish them all the best.|107450|020129|1|Scr29ja02-155 1.txt|16|89|S221-S222|4522|720|SD|Tom Daschle|S|NA|Democratic

10720020034086|Madam President, I rise today to voice my support for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda which is the often- neglected sister court to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia at the Hague. While the international media carries regular coverage of the Milosevic trial and the NATO efforts to arrest individuals wanted by the ICTY, much of the world, it seems, has forgotten about the ICTR. This week, as the UN's fifth committee considers the tribunal's budget, I want to make plain my continuing concerns about the tribunal, but I also want to be crystal clear about my continued support for its work. In 1994, an unspeakable horror unfolded in the tiny central African site of Rwanda. Despite the initial references to ``ancient tribal hatreds'' at the source of violence, we now know that the genocide was not a series of spontaneous acts; it was not about crowds gone wild or tribal bloodlust. It was carefully planned and centrally directed. Extra machetes had been imported, militia groups were in place, and incitements to murder had become a regular element of programming on the hate-radio station. The planners targeted not only ethnic Tutsis, but also politically moderate Hutus who threatened their grip on power. We know today that individual people--leaders and planners--are responsible for the deaths of some 800,000 people, and that the blame for these atrocities cannot be heaped on some imagined cultural failing. Two weeks ago, I had an opportunity to visit the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha during a weeklong trip to Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique that I undertook in my capacity as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's Subcommittee on African Affairs. During my brief visit, I was able to meet with the Deputy Registrar, with Judge Navanetham Pillay, who is the President of the ICTR, and with some members of the Prosecutor's office. I was also able to sit in on one of the trials underway--that of Laurent Semanza, a former mayor of Bicumbi who is charged with several counts of genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide and crimes against humanity, including rape. I heard some of the wrenching testimony in that case, and was astounded at the strength of the tribunal officials, whose work requires them to confront the horrible facts of the Rwandan genocide every day of their work. For many years, I have strongly supported accountability measures in cases where crimes against humanity have occurred, and I think that international support for such measures is particularly important in Africa, where too often the international community fails to respond to atrocities the way we would if such acts occurred in Europe or North America. For this reason, I have been a supporter of the Special Court for Sierra Leone. I have long supported the ICTR. In the last Congress, I authored legislation that was signed into law that would extend the U.S. rewards program to allow our government to offer and pay rewards for information about individuals wanted by the tribunal. The reason that we did this is because this provision had already existed for the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia--an example of how a double standard relating to the courts was at one time institutionalized in our government. What had happened since the Arusha tribunal's inception is nothing short of groundbreaking. The ICTR was responsible for the very first international convictions for the crime of genocide. Many people do not realize this, although the international community adopted the definition of the crime of genocide following the holocaust, it was the ICTR that launched the first successful investigation and prosecution for that crime. It was the first-ever international tribunal to convict an individual of rape as a crime against humanity and to rule that rape can be a crime of genocide. The Tribunal was the first such institution to actually convict a national leader, the former Prime Minister of Rwanda, of genocide. The court has established principles of international law that will be studied in law schools around the world for generations to come. And more importantly, it is establishing, in the minds of African leaders and African elites and African societies, the possibility that those responsible for crimes against humanity may one day be held accountable for their actions. In central Africa in particular, this goal is essential to ending the culture of impunity for gross violations of human rights, whether they occur in Rwanda or Burundi or eastern Congo. The people who have been laboring in Arusha to hold those most responsible for the genocide and for crimes against humanity in Rwanda in 1994 deserve recognition, and respect, and support. Now, there are a number of steps that the international community can take to help this worthy effort. First, we can ensure that the prosecutor's office is adequately staffed. It is almost appalling that the post of Deputy Prosecutor has been vacant since the middle of last year. I was informed that vacancies exist throughout the office. The UN has to speed up its recruitment process, priortizing the expeditious placement of competent applicants in important jobs, rather than starving the court of staff for the overriding goal of even geographic distribution of personnel. UN member states must also help to address another problem--that of sentence enforcement. Currently, few of the African countries willing to house persons convicted by the ICTR in their jails can meet international standards for prison conditions. Of course I am not suggesting that the international community refurbish the prisons of an entire continent. But I am suggesting that perhaps there are small and reasonable steps that we can take to help. And the US and the rest of the international community I think should support the tribunal's request for ad litum judges. They have already supported a similar request for the ICTY for the former Yugoslavia. All observers have been concerned about the pace of the tribunal. It makes sense to provide it with the capacity to move more quickly through its work. Mr. President, must has been made in recent days of the Administration's decision to publicly push for the ICTR and ICTY to finish their work in the next few years. And the need to wrap- up the Tribunal's work is not in dispute--in my meetings with Tribunal officials, no one suggested that the Tribunal should not aim to finish its work by 2008. This consensus, however, does not change the fact that much important still remains to be done, and the tribunals will need continued support to complete it. Some have also suggested that the existence of tribunals has given the international community a rationale for neglecting developing of indigenous justice systems in countries subject to the tribunals. And I agree that this is a pitfall that must be avoided, and I strongly support efforts to strengthen the capacity and independence of the judiciary in countries that have suffered from wide-scale human rights violations. Last week, Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Pierre Prosper told the House International Relations Committee that ``the United States stands prepared to assist the states in rebuilding their shattered judicial systems to make them capable of dispensing truth- based justice and establishing systematic respect for the rule of law.'' I certainly hope he is right, because this is an indispensable element in the global effort to bring some stability to the heart of Africa. But I am not yet convinced that our actions will match this rhetoric, and I am specifically concerned that no funding is being requested in 2003 for the Great Lakes Justice Initiative. And while I am encouraged by the Rwandan Government's efforts to address the massive backlog of genocide-related cases through a system of community courts known as gacaca and believe that the international community should help the government in Kigali to ensure the integrity and efficacy of this effort, I also respect the Rwandan's decision not to attempt to try those most responsible for the genocide--known as Category One suspects--in these untested courts in which judges have very little training and where only limited safeguards exist for victims and for the accused. Madam President, it is important to acknowledge that much of the criticism that has been leveled at the tribunal is fair, and it reflects real, and in some cases ongoing problems with the ICTR. Too often in the past, allegations of waste and mismanagement proved to be accurate, and the tribunal must exercise constant vigilance to fight corruption and abuse. Decisive steps must be taken to address the issue of fee-splitting between those on trial and defense counsel. I was pleased to learn about some of the efforts currently underway during my visit. I have raised these issues with the Chief Prosecutor, I have raised them with U.N. officials in New York, I raised them in Arusha, and I will continue to raise them. And overall, the tribunal simply has to pick up the pace of its work. I believe that this, too, is being addressed. During my visit there were three cases being heard simultaneously. And as I have mention, providing additional judges to the ICTR will help to address this problem. Madam President, because this tribunal is so important, the international community must keep working to get it right. The ICTR still has a great deal of work to do, and the international community, including the United States, must ensure that they are operating with all the necessary support, and operating under clear demands for accountability and integrity. These two initiatives--supporting the court and demanding an end to corruption and waste--are not contradictory, they are complementary. I urge my colleagues and the administration to pursue both with equal vigor.|107545|020306|1|Scr06mr02-145 1.txt|16|167|S1593-S1594|9925|1612|WI|Russell Feingold|S|NA|Democratic

10720020038892|Madam President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his work and leadership on this issue. We are here because we believe any hope for peace in the Middle East must begin with the complete renunciation of terrorism by the Palestinian Liberation Organization and a strong, unwavering commitment to bring such terrorism to an end. We also believe that only with the leadership of the United States can there be a peaceful settlement and resolution of issues in the area. For the past 18 months, as the violence of the second Intifada has increased, the United States has consistently called upon Yasser Arafat to halt the terrorism he pledged to end in the Oslo accords. Unfortunately, Arafat has incited the violence and helped financially support the terrorists. We now know that one of Arafat's top advisers is directly involved in financing the illegal weapons purchases and terror activities of the Al Aqsa Brigade. We now know, according to documents seized by the Israeli Defense Forces, that Arafat was directly involved in efforts to illegally smuggle more than 50 tons of arms into Israel from Iran a few months ago. We now know that Arafat has failed to confiscate weapons of terrorist suspects. We know he has failed to arrest and hold suspected terrorists and is harboring suspects in the assassination of an Israeli Cabinet official in his own headquarters in Ramallah. In fact, much of the terrorism emanates from the heart of the PLO, carried out by the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, composed of members of Arafat's own Fatah faction. Since the beginning of the year, 209 people have been murdered and more than 1,500 injured in these suicide bombings. These are children, women, men--innocent civilians. The Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade claimed credit for numerous of these attacks, including on March 31, central Jerusalem, killing 3 people; March 3, killing 10 people in west Jerusalem; and January 31, when the first female bomber killed an elderly Israeli. A document seized by the Israel Defense Forces in Ramallah, signed by Arafat himself, approves funding for the Al Aqsa Brigades. On February 3, Arafat wrote a New York Times op-ed opposing violence against Israel. Yet he declared a few days later, in Ramallah, that ``we will make the lives of the infidels Hell'' and led a chant of ``A million martyrs marching to Jerusalem!'' And this past week, while Arafat spoke out against terrorism, his wife, in Paris, said she would be proud if she had a son who became a suicide bomber. I believe, sincerely, that this is not a leader who wants peace for his people. In fact, I believe the suicide bombings have been precisely calculated to destroy any chance for peace. If these suicide bombers cannot be stopped, the situation is going to continue to deteriorate, Israel will have to continue to exercise its legitimate right of self-defense, and the result will be full-scale military conflagration. Israel has done no less--and certainly no more--than what any country would do to defend itself. There has been a lamentable loss of life in the West Bank. And I grieve for it because I believe, very deeply, every life--Israeli or Palestinian--has equal value. But let us not forget that Israel's military operation has been one based on specific intelligence information, with specific military goals--to act directly against terrorists who before the start of the operation were carrying out daily suicide bombings against Israeli civilians--and carried out with considerable restraint. Certainly, Israel has not gone beyond what the United States and our allies have been doing in Afghanistan, or the United Kingdom in Northern Ireland, or the bloody French campaign in Algeria--let alone, what Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, or Iran do on almost a daily basis to quell dissent. Does anyone doubt that a suicide bombing in Cairo, or Riyadh, or Damascus, or Beirut, or Paris would be met with the strongest of reactions, as was the 9-11 terrorist incident here? There simply is no excuse for arming a teenage girl with bombs around her waist to blow up women and children. And this kind of terror is happening over and over again. So the time is now for this Senate to stand up, in a strong, unified voice, to condemn the actions of Chairman Arafat and his PLO and the terrorism that has spawned. Chairman Arafat has said one thing in English and another in Arabic. Chairman Arafat fans the flames and incites the people. We offer this bill, after witnessing the failure of efforts by Messrs. Tenet, Mitchell, Zinni, and, at least initially, Secretary Powell to break the deadlock largely because Chairman Arafat has not brought to an end the suicide bombing and other acts of terrorism. This legislation would require the President to report to Congress every 90 days, detailing the acts of terrorism engaged in by the Palestinian Liberation Organization or any of its constituent elements and, based on that report, to designate the PLO or its constituent elements as terrorist organizations, or explain why not. The legislation also finds that Chairman Arafat and the PLO have violated his commitment to peace through the recent purchase of 50 tons of offensive weaponry from Iran; that they are responsible for the murder of hundreds of innocent Israelis and the wounding of thousands more since October 2000, and that they have been directly implicated in funding and supporting terrorists who have claimed responsibility for a number of homicide bombings inside Israel. Because of the failure by the Palestinian Liberation Organization to renounce terrorism, the act would, A, downgrade PLO representation in the United States to before Oslo; B, place travel restrictions on senior PLO representatives at the United Nations; C, confiscate assets of PLO or Palestinian Authority or Chairman Arafat in the United States; D, deny visas to Chairman Arafat or other officials of the PLO or the Palestinian Authority. It is important to note that the President may, on a case-by-case basis, waive this provision based on national security considerations. The legislation presents a sense of the Senate outlining the first steps needed to reach peace. First, the United States should urge an immediate and unconditional end to all terrorist activities and commencement of a cease-fire. Two, Arafat and the PLO should turn over to Israel for detention and prosecution those wanted by the Israeli Government for the assassination of Israeli Minister of Tourism, Mr. Zeevi. Third, Arafat and the PLO should take broad and immediate action to condemn all acts of terrorism, including and especially suicide bombing, which has resulted in the murder of over 125 Israeli men, women, and children in the month of March alone and the injury of hundreds more; confiscate and destroy the infrastructure of terrorism, including weapons, bomb factories and materials, as well as end all financial support of terrorist activities; and to take positive steps to urge all Arab nations and individuals to cease funding terrorist operations and the families of terrorists. Finally, the President of the United States, working with the international community, with Israel and the Arab States, should continue the search for a comprehensive peace in the region. There is no question that there are serious differences to be reconciled between Israel and the Palestinian people and that only a political settlement can hopefully bring the violence in this region to an end. I believe the 1967 borders, borders which have the imprimatur of the United Nations, hold the key to a settlement. Despite serious differences about the refugee problem, ongoing security, and the status of Jerusalem, I believe peace can be achieved through negotiation and agreement. But I know it cannot be achieved through violence. The necessary first step is the end of the violence, the terrorism, and the suicide bombing. Once that is done, we are firmly convinced that if leaders on both sides want peace, the rest can all be worked out. S. 2195.

10720020051992|Mr. President, I am very hopeful the Senate will be able to get on the issue of prescription drug coverage very soon. This is an urgent issue for seniors and the people of this country. I want to spend a few minutes tonight talking about why this is so important and what I think the real challenge is to the Senate in the next couple of weeks. Mr. President, for the last quarter of the 20th century, the standard Government line on prescription drugs for older people was a little bit like the marquee of the big, old-fashioned theaters you would see downtown. The marquee sign was all lit up and it always read: ``Coming soon.'' But, for seniors, that ``soon'' just never seems to arrive. Years ago, when I was director of the Oregon Gray Panthers--I had the honor to be co-director for about 7 years before I was elected to the House--I got many of the questions then that all of us in the Senate get now. Seniors asked then, just as they do now at our town meetings, if anybody in Washington is ever going to provide some real help in paying for prescription medicines. I am very pleased that Senator Daschle has made this a priority issue for the Senate. He has made it very clear to me that he is willing to work with anybody in the Senate to finally get this job done and to get it done right. I think we know what this issue is all about for seniors, and that is the cost of medicine and coverage for medicine. In effect, cost and coverage really go hand in hand because if you are able to get seniors coverage, but you have not held down the cost, then you are not getting a whole lot for the Government's money. Of course, if you take steps to control costs, but many seniors still don't have the ability to meet even those costs, we will continue to have more and more older people fall between the cracks. So it is important that the Senate addresses both of these issues and addresses them right. I want to talk for a few minutes about what I think some of the key components are first of holding costs down. First, I think it is important that it be done with bargaining power in the private sector. In discussing this--and we will do this over the next couple of weeks--I want to describe what I was involved in back in the 1970s when I was co-director of the Oregon Gray Panthers. I remember one rainy night standing with a swarm of seniors around a labor union pharmacy that was barely bigger than a pill box. We were kicking off a program that night where seniors, through labor unions and others in the community, had been able to bargain with pharmaceutical concerns, and seniors were able to get their drugs at cost, plus a small monthly fee. It worked for the company, it worked for the seniors. The community pulled together, and in this little pharmacy, which I have said was really no bigger than a pill box, we saw that you could set up bargaining power right in the private sector. I think tonight, how many more older people in this country need the benefits of bargaining power today? So I am very hopeful that on this question of cost containment we focus on bargaining power. Senator Daschle made it clear that it is a priority to him. He will work with all our colleagues to make sure that is in a final bill and that we remember that across this country, and that what happened in Eugene, OR, more than 25 years ago has been duplicated elsewhere, and that what happened there is all about making sure people could have bargaining power in the private sector so that senior citizens can afford their medicine. The underlying legislation that is going to give all Americans--not just seniors, but all Americans--quicker access to generic drugs is another step toward private sector cost containment. I commend my colleagues--Senator Schumer, Senator McCain, and others--who have worked so hard on this legislation. After I had the honor of serving as codirector of the Gray Panthers, I served on the Health Subcommittee in the House of Representatives, and we had a chance to work on what I thought was historic legislation. It was drafted by our distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Utah, Orrin Hatch, and Congressman Waxman. It struck a good balance between holding down costs for seniors by making it easier to get access to generic medicine, while at the same time promoting innovation and research in the breakthrough products that are so important to seniors in this country. I believed the Congress got it right in that Hatch-Waxman legislation and that the legislation we will be considering over the next couple of weeks is going to continue that kind of balance. We may try to refine it, and I am certainly open to that, but I think it will continue that crucial balance that was put together in the historic Hatch-Waxman legislation of helping to contain the costs for seniors and others through access to generic medicine, while at the same time promoting the new cures, the new research, the exciting breakthrough products that are so important. What I have tried to contribute to the Senate on prescription drugs has been an effort to come up with solutions that are going to work in the real world for Americans trying to navigate our health care system. In the past two sessions of the Congress, Senator Snowe and I have introduced bipartisan legislation. Tonight for just a few minutes, I want to express my appreciation to Senator Daschle and others in the leadership because the bill they will try to offer when we get to the question of Medicare coverage for seniors has been a genuine effort to address each of the concerns Senator Snowe and I have focused on in our legislation. When we get to that question, we are sure to have Members say this country cannot afford such coverage. They are going to say that the costs have already accelerated today; that we are having a demographic tsunami coming in just a few years, with millions of more older people in 2009, 2010, and 2011 retiring, and they are going to say the country cannot afford for the Congress to cover prescription drugs for older people. I want to make it clear that, in my opinion, the Congress cannot afford not to cover senior citizens, and I want to give a short example of why this is so urgently needed. Not long ago, a physician in Hillsboro, OR, in the metropolitan area surrounding Portland, wrote to me that he put a senior citizen in a hospital for a 6-week course of antibiotics because it was the only way the patient could afford the treatment. Of course, when the senior goes into the hospital, Medicare Part A, which covers institutional services, picks up the bill, no questions asked. The check gets written by the program to cover the costs in the hospital. Of course, that same condition could have been treated under Medicare Part B, the outpatient portion of Medicare. Our assessment is that to spend 6 weeks in an Oregon hospital probably cost the Medicare Program $40,000, $50,000, $60,000, to pick up those huge costs for an individual who had to be hospitalized to get the benefit, whereas it probably would have cost a few hundred dollars to have treated that person on an outpatient basis under Part B of the Medicare Program. When we hear in this Chamber and elsewhere that America cannot afford to cover prescription drugs for seniors, I am going to do my best to remind people about what I heard from that physician in Hillsboro, OR, and it has been repeated all over this country, because I think it is clear we cannot afford not to have this important program. We know what needs to be done in the next few weeks. We ought to promote easier access to generics. It is one of the key parts of the equation of doing this right. We ought to make sure that seniors have bargaining power in the private sector. The model that will be used in the legislation Senator Graham and Senator Miller have drafted incorporated much of what I and Senator Snowe have been concerned about, and that is to make sure that bargaining power is structured in the private sector so that costs are not shifted to millions of other Americans. There is no Senator who wants, in the effort to come up with a prescription drug proposal for seniors, to end up shifting costs on to their children and their grandchildren. That is why private sector bargaining power, something about which I and Senator Snowe have felt strongly, and Senator Daschle has graciously worked with us on, is included in what the Senate is going to have a chance to vote for. Those are some of the key questions. I will wrap up by way of saying that as we move into this discussion over the next couple of weeks, we have one principal challenge as we try to pass a comprehensive bill and then have it go to discussions with our colleagues in the House, and that is to make it clear to the country that this is a real effort to help, and not just an exercise in election-year rhetoric. The seniors who have come to us at our meetings have watched this Congress and other Congresses debate this topic and come back to it sporadically from time to time. They want to know: Is this on the level? Is this a real effort now to do the job right? I believe it is. I believe the commitment is there now and that this is not just an election-year exercise. There are key principles. We have an opportunity to address the questions of cost and coverage in a way that can win the support of colleagues on both sides of the aisle. The question of private sector bargaining power, ensuring that the program is voluntary so that any senior who is comfortable with their existing coverage can continue it if they choose to do otherwise--these are principles that are going to be in the Graham-Miller proposal that can win the support of colleagues on both sides of the aisle. These are principles that can bring the Senate together. Let us make sure that at the end of this 2-week period, when we have had the opportunity to help seniors and help all Americans with respect to the cost of medicine, we do not let this opportunity slip away once again. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.|107411|020715|1|Scr15jy02-95 1.txt|16|174|S6802-S6803|10120|1825|OR|Ron Wyden|S|NA|Democratic

10720020059426|Mr. President, the gentleman who resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is the President of the United States of America, and although the Constitution does not specifically state it, his most important chore is to keep our people united, to keep our Nation united. Accordingly, this morning I am saddened by the reports of my leader, the majority leader, and my leader, Senator Byrd of West Virginia, because it appears that our administration and our President are making statements that only serve to divide our people. I have been honored to serve as chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. Four weeks ago, this subcommittee reported a bill unanimously. It is a Democratically controlled subcommittee, but it reported a measure unanimously. It went to the full committee, chaired by the Senator from West Virginia, and the committee reported that measure unanimously. It was reported to this floor, and by an almost unanimous vote--three Members had questions--it passed the Senate. That was 4 weeks ago. That was carried out by a Democratically controlled Senate. There are a few footnotes in history that I think we should recall. I listened to all the talk shows on Sunday. I am a good listener. I very seldom speak on the floor. One statement was made that some of us in the early 1990s questioned the war in the Persian Gulf. I was one of those. This spokesperson said: They questioned the war because they said a lot of body bags would be returning, and just a few returned. But we should recall that the war ended at the border of Iraq. If we had gone into Baghdad, we would have had many body bags, unless the United States had decided to do the most inhuman thing and wipe out Baghdad--men, women, and children. Some have now suggested: The war in Afghanistan has resulted in 100 casualties. That is not a war. There is another footnote in history that we should recall. In that ancient war we engaged in 60 years ago, World War II, in the U.S. Army, 95 percent of the men in uniform had no spouses; there were no children. Five percent had spouses and children. In my regiment, 4 percent had spouses and children; 96 percent were young men, 18, 19, 20. We were ready. We had no strings attached. Today, in the U.S. Army, over 77 percent of our men and women have spouses; they have children. We should be concerned about their sensitivities. It is not easy going into combat. No one enters battle planning to become a hero. You just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. If you stepped one foot to the right, the bullet would have missed you.|107145|020925|29|Scr25se02-149 1.txt|409|451|S9186-S9200|2579|455|HI|Daniel Inouye|S|NA|Democratic

10820030002064|Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, when a baby is in the womb and someone violently attacks the mother and causes injuries or takes the life of that child, then the offender should be held responsible, and current law is unjust in that case. An individual who commits a Federal crime of violence against a pregnant woman receives no additional punishment for killing or injuring the woman's unborn child while committing the crime. The Unborn Victims of Violence Act protects the unborn child from violent crime. Those who injure or kill the child will be charged with a separate offense. The legislation is being called merely symbolic by its opponents. But how many women in America would view the loss of their wanted unborn child through violent means as merely symbolic? All we have to do is ask the woman who has just lost her child after a violent attack, it is not the same thing as a simple assault. Clearly it is more serious, and it is more emotionally jarring to that woman, and it should be treated accordingly. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this rule and to support the underlying legislation.|108900|030213|1|Hcr13fe03pt2-145 1.txt|16|18|H681|96|16|NA|Speaker|NA|NA|N/A

10820030005579|Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for bringing this important subject up because I have asked the President because many people asked me, Why does the President not fight back? Why does he not explain? And his simple answer to me was he cannot take the Presidency down into those baseless claims of people that are coming from everywhere. He stays focused on the job of fighting the war on terror. He has made tremendous accomplishments in the war on terror as we look across the history of the changes in just the last 3 years and even the recent incident along the Pakistani- Afghanistan border where U.S. troops are on the Afghanistan side and Pakistani troops were pinching in together al Qaeda troops in the middle. I think that indicates some of the most dramatic changes going on in the region, and this President, in spurning a policy of appeasement but choosing instead to respond in strength and remaining dignified and not dipping the Presidency into the baseless accusations that have been hurled from every direction during the last 8 or 9 months, indicates a steadfastness, a commitment to duty that this President brings that makes me proud. I thank both of the gentlemen for bringing these conversations in front of the American people. I think this is the right place to refute the lies that are being thrown about.

10820030009534|Maybe one of these weeks we could talk about No Child Left Behind. And I do not want to get into a K through 12 debate now, but it is the same issue. In Ohio, for example, the State legislature did a study, No Child Left Behind underfunded by $1.4 billion. So now that means that the State, in order to fulfill their obligations to the Federal mandate, must come up with more money. Does that mean they will take more from the college subsidies for higher education that the State puts on? Does that mean more of an increase to the property tax of someone who is paying property tax in the State of Ohio? Where will we get this money? I guess the thing I want to communicate is that this is doable. The beautiful thing about this democracy is that it belongs to us. And if young people want to participate in this system and in an election from Republican to Democrat, then they can do it. There are enough students out there to make this happen. If you want the millionaires' tax cuts to go away or not necessarily even go away, just a portion of it going away to pay for this, that is doable. If you get active and you get involved, let us know, 30somethingdems@mail. house.gov. Let us know what your ideas are. We need young people to participate in this process and replenish this system because it has become very stagnant down here. It has become a very small group of people who raise money, dump it into this institution, get the legislation they want. That legislation helps them make more money and they take their profits and it is a cycle that goes on and on. And the only thing that combats that is democracy and young people getting involved in the process.|108217|030410|42|Hcr10ap03pt2-10 1.txt|2058|2059|H3268-H3279|71|12|ME|Thomas Allen|H|1|Democratic

10820030015827|Madam Speaker, I find it ironic to stand here on the floor and I am not one that is so lucky to be on the Committee on Energy and Commerce but I am one that spends weekends at home every week. I am amazed to stand here on the floor and hear the comments from the other side which offer absolutely no solution whatsoever to an abatement of the price of gasoline that we pay today. None whatsoever. There is an old saying in Washington that oftentimes legislation comes forward in search of a problem. The response from the minority party today is that they come forward with testimony in search of a policy. They have nothing. At least we are over here trying. The testimony we have heard this afternoon about the boutique fuels across the country, there is no refuting that. That is an absolute fact. It is directly related to an outgrowth of the passage of a policy that has been refined and perfected by the Members of that side of the aisle when they were in the majority. The people of America are paying a price in the form of higher prices for gas on the basis of policies they put into place. We are trying to reverse those. We are trying to increase refinery capacity. We are trying to reduce the number of boutique fuels that exist across this country and increase the fungibility of gasoline between markets so that people in Maine or people in California or people in Wisconsin or Missouri can all buy gasoline that is essentially the same. They have not come forward with a single material improvement to the infrastructure that exists today. They resist us on fixing the permitting process for refiners. They resist us on fixing the permitting process for pipelines. They resist us on fixing the permitting process to bring gasoline into the country in the form of refined products. They resist, they resist, they resist. I understand their policy. I applaud them for it. There is an election every 2 years. I hope the voters are paying attention. I rise today to discuss H.R. 4545, the ``The Gasoline Price Reduction Act of 2004,'' introduced by Messrs. Blunt and Ryan. I welcome this legislation today because I share their concerns over high gasoline prices and the proliferation of boutique fuels. Today's gasoline market is comprised of many types of gasoline that serve different regional markets to meet varying Federal and State environmental requirements. At last count, there were approximately 19 different types of gasoline in the U.S. Arguably, there are almost 60 types if you take into account that each is made into three different octane blends. Although these numerous fuel blends are seen as an efficient means of cleaning the air, the increase in boutique fuels adds a level of complexity into production, distribution, and storage of gasoline. The result of this targeted approach to air quality has been to balkanize the gasoline market and to create gasoline market islands. The primary examples are in my home State of California and the Chicago/Milwaukee area, in which the required gasoline blends are unique, and only a limited number of refineries make the products. Small disruptions in production, such as refinery outages or pipeline ruptures, can severely limit the supply of gasoline in these areas, causing artificial shortages and price spikes. Over the last four years, my Government Reform Energy Policy Subcommittee has held four hearings on gasoline markets . What I have learned from these hearings is that we should not be in the business of mandating what goes into a gallon of gasoline. Instead of dictating gasoline components, we should set high performance standards for what comes out of the tailpipe and let industry meet them. Anyone who knows anything about the gasoline problems in California can tell you that the de facto ethanol mandate in California is significantly affecting gasoline supply and is not necessarily improving the environment. In fact, using ethanol in California may actually degrade air and water quality. Despite ample scientific data, and letters from the California delegation, including two I sent as Subcommittee Chairman in February 2004 and April 2004, the Environmental Protection Agency has yet to approve California's oxygen waiver request, which is environmentally and economically sound. From these hearings, I have also learned that several measures need to be taken to address the gasoline supply issues in the U.S. One measure that is key to increasing supply is the expansion and enhancement of the entire petroleum infrastructure, which is currently stressed and at its limits. Addressing the constraints and bottlenecks within the petroleum infrastructure, which includes refineries, pipelines, storage tanks, and port facilities, is important because each component of the system must function properly and efficiently to ensure consumers receive an adequate and affordable supply of gasoline. Given the ever-widening gap between gasoline supply and demand in the U.S., we should look at ways to simplify the various infrastructure permitting processes and to reduce the costs and uncertainty associated with Federal and State regulations. If we fail to do so, we will be faced with increasing imports, increasing gasoline prices, or both. I venture to say that no American would be pleased with these outcomes. Additionally, we must consider ways to reduce the regulatory burden facing the refining industry. Refiners will need to invest about $20 billion in the next decade to comply with Federal and State environmental regulations. As a result, less capital will be available for refinery maintenance and expansion, and some smaller refineries may close. We must examine ways to achieve our desired environmental results without putting companies out of business.|108485|030603|16|Hcr03jn03-142 1.txt|597|614|H4857-H4862|1110|222|TX|Ciro Rodriguez|H|28|Democratic

10820030018894|Mr. Speaker, before yielding time, I yield myself such time as I may consume, because I would just would like to remind my colleague, the gentleman from West Virginia, that there may not have been any successful suicide attempts in some time; there are weekly suicide attempts which are thwarted by the vigilance of the Israeli Defense Force. So the fact that suicide bombers do not succeed in blowing up additional groups of innocent civilians is not an indication that the attempts at suicide bombings have come to an end. Secondly, may I remind my friend that innocent civilians are killed in ways other than through suicide bombing. A pregnant mother and four of her young daughters were killed in cold blood just this past month. A pregnant woman with four small daughters in her car, all six of them were killed just this past month. So I do not think it is accurate to portray a picture which would indicate that the attempts at extremist violent terrorism is over. The attempts are less successful than they were at a time when Israel was less prepared to deal with it.|108451|030618|28|Hcr18jn03-83 1.txt|496|516|H5475-H5491|1260|234|TN|Marsha Blackburn|H|7|Republican
10820030018897|Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. I would respond to the gentleman that I condemn those attacks as well, and I would say that there have been attempts thwarted by the Israeli security forces. Mr. Speaker, the Israelis have not done that alone, they have had a great deal of information submitted to them from a lot of other countries, and from moderate Palestinians, working within whatever security apparatus they have left. The Palestinians who truly want to see peace and recognize how horrendous these actions are want to help stop terrorism. In addition, let us not forget innocent Palestinians. I am sure the gentleman would agree there have been a number of those that have lost their lives since the Intifada and many other skirmishes. I would say to the gentleman as well, I am sure he recognizes that under this administration, there have been over 900 Israelis and foreigners who have lost their lives during the last 3 or 4 years, which is 10 times more than the number of Israelis and foreigners that lost their lives under the Clinton administration. So let us help this President take advantage of the opportunities that are presented to him to achieve a breakthrough in the region.

10820030019708|Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution for the transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqi people on June 30. June 30 will be the start of a new Iraq. Life for the people of Iraq will be a world away from the cruelty and tyranny of the regime that once ruled them for decades. A new sovereign, interim Iraqi government-- representing the diversity of Iraq--will assume power, provincial governments will be put in place, courts will be overseen by Iraqi justices, political parties will be formed and preparations for national elections will be made. After June 30, the U.S., under the leadership of Ambassador John Negroponte, will provide support to the new Iraqi Interim Government as it assumes control of managing day-to-day operations, preparations for new elections, and rebuilding the country's infrastructure and economy. Leading up to June 30, infrastructure improvements--led by coalition forces--and the shift to self-government have already completely transformed the face of Iraq. Schools, medical clinics and hospitals have been reopened. An army and more effective police force have been rebuilt. A fair judicial system has been constituted. And an interim constitution has been signed--laying the foundation for democratic elections. The ability to transfer authority to a new sovereign Iraq only 14 months after liberation efforts began is a major step forward for freedom. We should be proud of our young servicemen and women and civilian contractors in Iraq for their work in liberating 25 million Iraqis from the grip of Saddam Hussein's regime and rebuilding a country that was in disrepair for nearly two decades. America appreciates their sacrifice and commitment to the security of our Nation. Those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our freedom and defend America will never be forgotten. Mr. Speaker, July 1, 2004 will be the dawn of a new day for the men, women and children of Iraq. This day will not mean an end to terrorist violence, but it will be a radical departure from the decades of governmental and personal abuse that existed under Saddam's ruthless regime.|108157|030623|9|Hcr23jn03-93 1.txt|337|477|H5696-H5701|9034|1612|IL|Rahm Emanuel|H|5|Democratic

10820030020449|Mr. Speaker, this is the third day in a row that I have come to the floor to speak in protest of the unfair practice by the City of Miami in allocating Federal urban security money to Broward and Palm Beach Counties. Of the $30 million allocated to the south Florida urban area, zero dollars, zero, have been assigned to Palm Beach County. For the City of Miami to neglect providing the necessary funding for this county is simply outrageous, in that they have kept 90 percent of these funds for themselves. Palm Beach County is home to 1.2 million people, and it has a large and very busy international airport, as well as three general aviation airfields. The port of Palm Beach is the fourth busiest container port in Florida and the 18th busiest in the continental United States, making it an attractive target for would-be terrorists. Mr. Speaker, the hijackers of September 11 spent part of their time in south Florida, and Palm Beach was the site of an anthrax attack, killing one person and injuring many more; and, yet, Palm Beach County is not getting one dime in antiterrorist funds. This is outrageous, Mr. Speaker, and I am asking Homeland Security to designate Broward and Palm Beach Counties as its own region under the Urban Area Security Initiative Program so that we can be eligible to receive the necessary funds we must protect our infrastructure, our community and our residents.|108900|030625|16|Hcr25jn03-69 1.txt|401|402|H5822-H5825|87|15|NA|Speaker|NA|NA|N/A

10820030022291|Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the gentleman from Tennessee , my good friend. I would say that, in an ideal world, this would be a good amendment. I would define an ideal world as one in which money was unlimited. In short, it is a world very different from the one in which we live. This amendment would add $88 million in additional spending to the bill. That is just not realistic in this budget environment. And quite rightly, the administration is not going to support a bill that adds that much more money. So what this amendment would do is kill the bill. If we truly want to help manufacturers, we need to defeat this amendment. And let me emphasize once again that this bill already contains a significant increase for the MEP program, an increase of more than 200 percent from current levels. So this is hardly a parsimonious bill. The additional money the gentleman from Tennessee is proposing would be nice, but it is not critical to the success of the MEP program. The money that is already in the bill is critical, a 200 percent increase; and we should be doing what we can to ensure that this bill becomes law. In addition to adding money, the gentleman from Tennessee's amendment would increase the Federal share of the MEP centers' budgets. I know that the MEP centers have not had the best year, but I do not think that increasing the share from the Federal Government is necessarily a good idea. Let me remind my colleagues that the original version of the MEP centers was that they would not receive any money after their 6th year. The current MEP formula involves a true partnership between the Federal Government, the States, and the MEP's clients. That is a good partnership that ensures that MEPs are truly providing valiant services. I do not think we should tinker with a successful formula. So I urge defeat of this amendment. The base bill already provides the money the MEP centers need most through a formula that ensures that the centers will continue to be responsive to their States and, most importantly, to the customers that they are trying to help. This amendment would sink the bill, a pretty high price to pay for an amendment that does not provide anything that is necessary and that tinkers with a recipe that has led to MEP's success, and I urge its defeat. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.|108535|030710|78|Hcr10jy03-26 1.txt|3449|3450|H6470-H6535|68|12|WI|David Obey|H|7|Democratic
10820030023788|Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker, the administration strongly supports H.R. 4759, which will approve and implement the U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement as signed by the United States and Australia on May 18 of this year. The U.S.-Australia FTA advances U.S. national economic interests and meets the negotiating principles and objectives set out by the Congress in the Trade Act of 2002. The agreement enhances our close trade relationship with Australia and will further open Australia's market for U.S.-manufactured goods, agricultural products, and services. As soon as the FTA enters into force, tariffs will be eliminated on nearly all manufactured goods traded with Australia. In addition, Australia will eliminate tariffs on all exports of U.S. agricultural products. The U.S.-Australia FTA further solidifies our relationship with an important partner in the global economy and a strategic ally. It sets a strong example of the benefits of free trade and democracy. Opening markets is part of the President's six-point plan for continuing to strengthen America's economy and to create more opportunities for American workers and farmers.

10820030024447|Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Farr-Schakowsky- McGovern amendment. Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment about America, about us, and about the pressures placed on our uniformed men and women serving in the Armed Forces. In effect, this amendment matches what the House has already approved in the Defense authorization bill. In this sense, it is a conforming amendment. Everyone in this House knows that America's troops are stretched dangerously thin. Every day, there is a story in one of the major papers about the stresses facing American troops as more are deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere around the world. We are diverting troops from South Korea to Iraq, and we are placing burdens on our Guard and Reservists just to give some small amount of relief to our regular military units before they are redeployed into combat once again. Faced with these tremendous strains, the administration has come forward and asked Congress to double the number of troops in Colombia, offering no more compelling a rationale than Colombia needs more of our men and women for their civil war. The Farr amendment, like the Taylor provision in the Defense authorization bill, offers a prudent alternative: provide a modest increase of 150 more troops, give the U.S. military in Colombia a bit more flexibility and relief, retain the private contractor cap at 400, and evaluate our global military situation over the next 12 months. I do not want any Member of this House to be fooled. This latest bid to raise the military troop cap will not be the last. The administration has assured Congress repeatedly that no increase to the troop cap would be necessary; yet, now their story has changed. Will it change again in another year or two? Let us refresh our memories on what the administration has told Congress about the current troop cap. On April 4, 2001, General Peter Pace, commander of the U.S. Southern Command said, ``That troop cap, sir, is well within the limits that I need to do the job that I have been given, and I support it.'' On October 4, 2002, Brigadier General Galen Jackman, J-3 Chief of Operations at the U.S. Southern Command testified, ``We have a 400- person military cap in Colombia. We do not envision that that is going to change. Typically, we have maybe a couple of hundred people in the country at any given time.'' On March 7, 2003, Mark Grossman, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs stated, ``There are caps on the number of people who can be in Colombia at any one time, and there is no one who is advocating the breaking of those caps.'' And on August 19, 2003, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld declared, ``I think it would be unlikely to be anything that would break that cap.'' Mr. Chairman, when Plan Colombia was first launched and American troops first sent down to Colombia, Congress was told we were only going to fight the drug trade. Then we were asked to commit our troops to fight not only a drug war, but to join the campaign in a counterterrorist, a counterinsurgency civil war. Now we are being asked to double the number of our soldiers, boots on the ground in Colombia. There is a term for what is happening in Colombia. It is called ``mission creep.'' Mr. Chairman, Congress was right 4 years ago to impose military personnel caps in Colombia. It was a smart and prudent safeguard against any rapid escalation of U.S. involvement in Colombia's internal armed conflict. We did the right thing then. The Farr-Schakowsky- McGovern amendment is the right thing to do now. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment on U.S. troop caps in Colombia.|108900|030717|75|Hcr17jy03-66 1.txt|872|1321|H7048-H7058|189|32|NA|Speaker|NA|NA|N/A

10820030026443|Mr. Speaker, today the House of Representatives is acting well within its Constitutional authority in considering H.R. 3313. Currently, many state courts including those in Massachusetts have begun the process of defining marriage through judicial decree. Because of the Constitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause, this judicial activism may be forced upon all the remaining states, including Utah, undermining the traditional definition of marriage and family. These and other state and federal courts imperial judges are acting in an extra-constitutional fashion and assuming the powers of legislatures. In Massachusetts, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts ruled on a 4-3 vote in Goodridge v. Massachusetts Dep't of Health, 798 N.E. 2d 941 that the state's refusal to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples violated the state constitution. The court found that the traditional definition of marriage, the same definition used throughout history, was evidence of ``invidious'' discrimination. In a follow-up opinion, these same judges stated the current definition of marriage in Massachusetts was a ``stain'' on the state constitution and needed to be ``eradicated''. On May 17th of this year, the Goodridge decision went into effect and the state of Massachusetts began issuing same-sex marriage licenses. This new and expanded definition of marriage opens many more questions than it answers. What happens if these individuals move to other states after they are married? What benefits and rights must the new jurisdiction accommodate and what other obligations will be thrust on a jurisdiction that does not recognize such unions? These are difficult and divisive questions, and this is why representatives elected by the people and not the courts should decide them. Those opposed to an open and deliberative debate and public votes by elected legislators have preferred judicial activism instead. The Defense of Marriage Act, which passed both Houses of Congress and was signed into law by President Clinton, is central to our debate. DOMA was passed to prevent one state from imposing its family law policy on another state. Historically, family law has always been left to the states. However, scholars on both sides of the ideological aisle have stated their Constitutional concerns with the language of DOMA. If DOMA challenges are successful, then one case in one court could conceivably set social policy for the nation. When the judicial branch loses its moral compass, it is the responsibility of the Congress to exert its authority to keep the judicial branch in check. In this particular circumstance, the Congress has two options. The first is a Constitutional Amendment. The second is assertion of its authority in the Constitution under Article III, Section 2 clause 2 and ``regulate'' the jurisdiction of the federal courts and make ``exceptions'' to their jurisdiction. I have reservations about amending the U.S. Constitution. But that may be our last resort. As President Bush stated, ``If judges insist on forcing their arbitrary will upon the people, the only alternative left to the people would be the constitutional process.'' I agree with President Bush. We are debating H.R. 3313, which limits the role of federal courts. This legislation states, ``No court created by an act of Congress shall have any jurisdiction, and the Supreme Court shall have no appellate jurisdiction, to hear or decide any question pertaining to the interpretation of, or the validity under the Constitution of, section 1738C.'' The referenced section relates to the DOMA language allowing states to opt to not recognize the same-sex marriages of another state. HR 3313 is simply Congress reaffirming its intent under DOMA and disallowing judicial review. Some argue that Congress should not limit the jurisdiction of the federal courts. I would like to remind them of the provision Senator Daschle inserted into a Defense Appropriations bill in the 107th Congress that exempted all forest management projects in the Black Hills National Forest from any further NEPA requirements, from administrative appeals, from Endangered Species Act Section 7 consultation procedures, from review by any court, and from court ordered injunctions. I agreed with Senator Daschle and supported this legislation not only because it set a precedent for good forest policy, but also because it is a precedent for Congress's authority to limit the jurisdiction of the courts. Chief Justice Marshall inferred in Marbury v. Madison that if the Supreme Court identifies a conflict between a constitutional provision and a congressional statute, the Court has the authority to declare the state unconstitutional. It is clear that Congress has the duty and responsibility to make sure that no act promulgated by it exceeds the Constitution. In this particular case, the Congress is exerting its explicit authority to limit the jurisdiction of the Courts. This cannot be held unconstitutional by the federal courts or the Supreme Court because they cannot hear it. They have no jurisdiction because Congress withholds jurisdiction. It is the natural check on the courts' power that the founding fathers built into our system of checks and balances. I say with all sincerity to those opposed to this legislation, the spirit of the law is explicit. State family law is for the states to decide. The Supreme Court in a 2004 decision, Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow, 124 S. Ct. 2301, 2309 , reaffirmed this presumption by stating, ``the whole subject of domestic relations . . . belongs to the laws of the State and not to the laws of the United States.'' If the opponents of this legislation deny this reaffirmation of the law, a Constitutional Amendment to protect the definition of marriage is the only alternative. I urge a ``yes'' vote.|108324|030723|4|Hcr23jy03pt2-10 1.txt|58|175|H7444-H7449|7420|1293|NY|Timothy Bishop|H|1|Democratic

Without this amendment, we put our workers at a great, great disadvantage, allow our air to be unduly polluted and make our highways less safe. The gentleman from Arizona says it is about the Teamsters. No, it is about the American people who use America's highways. If trucks from Mexico are going to bring products into our country, using our highways, these trucks need to be held to the same safety and emission standards to which our own trucks are held. At present, Mexican trucks are not held to American standards for safety and emissions. Allowing an 18-wheel truck loaded with 88,000 pounds of cargo to speed over our highways without ensuring that the vehicle is safe simply makes no sense. Mexican drivers must be subject to the same level of scrutiny that we demand of our American drivers with regard to training and recordkeeping and incident violations.

10820030031886|Mr. Speaker, allow me to thank the great leadership we have on this committee and the diligence with which they have led us and with which we have worked. The gentleman from Alaska , the gentleman from Minnesota , the gentleman from Wisconsin , and the gentleman from Illinois , the members of the committee respect and honor their leadership. It makes for a very good committee. Three in four Americans now believe that the Nation is facing a transportation capacity crisis. Our infrastructure desperately needs attention. There are 17 bridges in my district alone that are currently in critical condition. Yet in spite of this, we stand poised to shortchange the American people with another short-term highway extension. If you poll any local, State, or transportation industry representatives, they will tell you that the transportation needs of this country will only be met by passing a fully funded 6-year bill, $376 billion, but no less than $319 billion. We did not pull these numbers out of the air. They are numbers from the administration's own Department of Transportation's research and assessment. Our leaders in this committee traveled this country looking at conditions to verify what we have been told by the administration. It is ironic that the current argument is over funding levels. Yet the longer we delay in enacting a fully funded transportation bill, the costs associated with addressing our Nation's infrastructure will continue to rise. So just neglecting going through and doing what is right, we are going to cause ourselves to spend more money. If the Republican administration can find time to place such a great emphasis on the reconstruction of other countries, surely priority should be given to our Nation's crumbling infrastructure and bringing the needed jobs. Our constituents are counting on us to do the right thing and we really should not let them down. We have cars collapsing on bridges. The highways are so bad until accidents are being caused. It is time for us to stand up and pass this bill and do something for our Nation and bring about good jobs.|108900|030925|5|Hcr25se03-99 1.txt|45|47|H8916-H8922|90|15|NA|Speaker|NA|NA|N/A
10820030034007|Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Madam Speaker, we certainly know that the legislative calendar for this year was set to complete our work on October 1. We are now here on October 7 and working to get our work done. And it is my hope that we continue on the 9/11 debate today and other important matters pending. It is also my hope that we are able to consider the legislation dealing with the American Jobs Act of 2004. We know that since this last hour, that we are asking the body to consider a same-day rule so that we can consider the legislation if and when the Committee on Rules meets and sends to this floor a rule for consideration of the underlying legislation. We know that the gentleman from California has personally come and filed the report for the conference report before this body, and we have seen in the last hour both what the bill looks like, with some 1,300 pages and 12, 13 inches thick, and we heard me previously say that the Committee on Ways and Means Web site address, waysandmeans.house.gov, if you go to ``What's New'' and you look for conference documents, you will find the conference report, which is bipartisanly signed, in its entirety. And, if you want, the Adobe Acrobat has the word search so that you can find anything you are interested in finding. This legislation has been around for a while. Again, I will repeat myself, as I have several times in this debate: It has nothing in it within the provisions that was not considered in this body or the other body by as the conferees came together. It was an open conference, even though the motion to instruct was defeated, and we followed the Senate rules whereby members of the conference could file numerous and countless amendments, which were considered, and we now have a final word product. I know the debate on the floor, as we get through this, either today or this early evening or if it ends up tomorrow, will have all sorts of interpretations. We will get down to the fact that it is going to help American business, and that includes small business, farmers, and small manufacturers. The Republican leadership and the Committee on Rules has met. They are not acting against the rules of this House. Quite frankly, we have asked for consideration of the body by majority vote to determine if we can have a same-day consideration, and that is what is going to happen as we have a vote here shortly. Mr. Speaker, I move the previous question on the resolution, which is same-day consideration of the legislation before us, and I yield back the balance of time.

10820030041679|Mr. President, as a strong defender of law-abiding Americans' second amendments rights, today I join my colleagues, Senators Reed, DeWine, Lieberman, Chafee, and Dodd to offer a bipartisan compromise amendment to address what has become known as the gun show loophole. Currently an individual can walk into a gun show and purchase a firearm from either a federally licensed dealer or an unlicensed dealer. A background check is only performed on that individual if he or she buys a gun from a licensed dealer. There is no requirement--I repeat, no requirement--for a background check of any kind when purchasing a firearm from an unlicensed dealer. This is a very dangerous loophole in the law and we are doing a disservice to the American people if we allow it to remain open. This amendment would close this dangerous loophole in our gun safety laws in a way that is respectful of the rights of gunshop operators, gun show vendors, and gun show enthusiasts. It defines gun shows in a reasonable manner to cover only public events where at least 75 firearms are offered for sale. It specifically exempts from regulation any private sale from the home, such as yard sales or estate sales. Additionally, it exempts sales between members of hunt clubs, an exception that I know is important to a number of our colleagues who represent hunting and sporting clubs that occasionally sell, trade, or raffle firearms between club members. The amendment would also create a new category of licensees who can become deputized to perform background checks for unlicensed sellers at gun shows. This licensee, who could even be a gun show employee, would enable any unlicensed vendor to conveniently have an instant background check performed when selling a firearm. In addition, this amendment would allow States to graduate to an even faster instant check once they have sufficiently automated the records necessary to ensure that a faster check does not sacrifice accuracy. Why do we need this amendment? Some might point to tragedies such as Columbine, but as horrific as the massacre at Columbine was, where 11 young people needlessly lost their lives, that is not what drives the need to close the gun show loophole. We need this amendment because criminals and terrorists have exploited and are exploiting this very obvious loophole in our gun safety laws. We need this amendment because our second amendment rights do not extend to criminals who violate our laws and terrorists who hate this country. We need this amendment because, according to the NRA, ``hundreds of thousands'' of unlicensed firearms sales occur at gun shows each year. We need this amendment because ATF has identified gun shows as the second leading source of firearms recovered from illegal gun trafficking investigations. We also need this amendment because my law-abiding constituents who attend gun shows in Arizona should not have to rub shoulders with the scum of the Earth who use this loophole to evade background checks to buy firearms to peddle to God knows who. We need this because every one of the 15 leading gun trafficking States in America has not taken action to close the gun show loophole. Conversely, 11 of the 15 States with the lowest level of interstate gun trafficking have taken action to close the gun show loophole. When discussing the topic of gun safety, I often hear my colleagues say things such as, let's enforce existing law before we make new ones. I completely agree and that is exactly what we are seeking to do today. We are seeking to strengthen existing laws by closing an enormous, dangerous loophole. I offer this amendment as one who counts himself as a strong supporter of the underlying legislation to protect the gun industry from frivolous lawsuits. I plan to vote for the underlying bill because it is fundamentally unfair to blame a firearms manufacturer when a criminal misuses a gun. But it is also unfair to the American people to knowingly leave open a gaping hole in our gun safety laws that criminals and terrorists can and do easily exploit. The last time the Senate considered similar legislation was in 1999, following the school shootings at Columbine High School. Two amendments were proposed to close the gun show loophole. One amendment received 51 votes with then-Vice President Gore casting his deciding vote. I opposed that amendment because, frankly, I thought it defined gun shows too broadly, covering certain private sales from the home, at yard sales, estate sales, and between members of private hunt clubs, places that obviously are not gun shows. The second amendment which I supported also passed the Senate. Unfortunately, opponents of that amendment said it weakened the Brady law for licensed dealers and created new loopholes. Today we offer a compromise proposal that is a reasonable, responsible consensus. I urge this body not to let this opportunity slip by. Opponents of today's amendment will make several arguments. I would like to take a few moments to address them head on. It is important to point out that this amendment is a modification of the legislation we introduced last fall. This amendment contains none of the vendor notification requirements contained in that bill. The vender notification requirements in this amendment are the same as those that passed the Senate in 1999. Let me state that again for clarity. This amendment does not contain the vendor notification provisions contained in S. 1807. They are gone. We still hear that criminals don't obtain guns from gun shows and we will hear about a survey of State and Federal inmates conducted by the Justice Department showing that about 3 percent of prisoners obtained their guns from gun shows. Let me make a couple of points. First, the survey was conducted in 1997. The gun show loophole didn't exist until December of 1993, so any criminal in prison for more than 3 years or any criminal who had a firearm for at least 3 years would not have had a reason to exploit this loophole. Second, let's be clear to quote ATF field agent Jeff Fulton: ``Crime guns do originate at gun shows. That's been documented.'' In fact, the ATF says gun shows are the second leading source of guns recovered in illegal trafficking investigations. Some opponents of this amendment will say that background checks take too long for weekend gun shows. That may have been the case in 1999, but today, thanks to the diligence of the Department of Justice, 91 percent of criminal background checks are completed within several minutes and over 95 percent of background checks are completed within 2 hours. For 19 out of 20 background checks, instant check has lived up to its name. For the 1 out of 20 checks that take more than 2 hours, these applicants are 20 times more likely to be unlawful than the rest of the applicants. Additionally, this amendment encourages States to improve their records, making them eligible for even faster background checks. I point out again that 91 percent of criminal background checks are completed within several minutes; 95 percent, within 2 hours. Opponents say the background check requirements would put gun shows out of business. That is not true. According to the Krause Gun/Knife Show Calendar, the definitive source of gun show information in the Nation, in 2003, the 17 States that have closed the gun show loophole have hosted, on average, more gun shows than the 33 States that have not closed the loophole. I repeat, the 17 States that have taken action to close the gun show loophole hosted, on average, 45 gun shows in 2003. The other 33 States, on average, 41 gun shows. I am a gun show supporter. Arizona is a big gun show State. This amendment will have zero effect on legitimate gun show businesses. This amendment has been endorsed by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Major Cities Chiefs of Police, the Conference Of Mayors--the list goes on and on with those who have to deal with the results of guns obtained illegally. Let me say that the administration has said they want a ``clean bill.'' The administration has supported closing the gun show loophole but now they want a ``clean bill.'' Wink-wink, nod-nod. It is remarkable. It is remarkable. This loophole needs to be closed. The administration has had the position that it needs to be closed. We all know it needs to be closed. There were two State referendums in the 2002 election, in Colorado, not notoriously a liberal State, and Oregon, not notoriously a conservative State. Both of those ballot initiatives carried overwhelmingly when taken to the people instead of the incredible influence of the NRA over this process.

10820030045434|You have a bill and you work on it, and Senators quickly run down and say, my gosh, this isn't going to help my State. But you cannot fix them all. So you proceed. They lose most of the time, but they never give up. On and on. That is all right. But it ends. I would like the bill to get called up. I would like us to vote on it. I would like the American people to know the contents of the bill. I have given you some today, and I hope what we will do each day this week and next week will bring down six or eight of the major policies, big ones. In this country, you cannot build new electric lines in certain places. You end up with what is called gridlock. You come this far and you run into a State on the other side that says you cannot get any right-of-way under any circumstance unless the people agree. They are not agreeing. Why should they? They don't want a pipeline, but America needs it--or an electric line. You know what we did in this bill, what I did as chairman? I got the majority, including Republicans, to agree you go about your business trying to get that done. But after a period of time, if you cannot, and it is found to be in the best interest of America, FERC will condemn you on it. We haven't gotten too much guff on it. A lot of people say, don't get the Federal Government involved. Who is going to do that? If we come up to that line, OK, if you want more electricity, where are you going to get it? That is a lot of places. It is fixed in this bill. I cannot do any more. There are a lot more and they are pretty good. Yes, some are not so good. Senator Grassley has made a big push for wind energy. One would wonder why Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Finance Committee of the Senate, would do that. But his State has made a push for it. This bill has a major new emphasis on wind energy. It is terrific. It continues the subsidy we have had that has brought this industry into motion. But do you know what? It is going to stop because what is needed to keep it going is in this bill. It is the same for geothermal and solar. I don't know what else to do. I have left it alone for a couple of months, thinking maybe somebody would do something. All I can do is, sooner or later, come down and say it is just not right--not right for our country, not right to blame other people when it is right smack in our lap.

10820030046610|Mr. President, this legislation has been long in coming Senator McCain and I have worked on this for months. I think it is a tremendous step forward. It is a perfect example of how we have to cooperate with each other. This is not everything that Senator McCain wanted, it is not everything I wanted, but it is legislation that now is going to pass the Senate. It is something that has been needed for some time. It is the Professional Boxing Safety Act, but it also will take a very close look at promoters, including those who are the networks, HBO, Showtime. It sets up a national boxing commission. It is important. This is a multimillion-dollar industry, and it needs Federal oversight as a result of deaths that occur with boxers. We had a death of a person from Nevada who went to Utah to fight. He had been knocked out 21 times. He went to Utah to fight and got knocked out again and died. As many of my colleagues know, I come to my work on boxing with a perspective that was formed both inside and outside the ring. Before I entered the political arena, I personally was a boxer. I also worked ringside as a judge in hundreds of fights, in all weight classes, and have judged championship fights. As a lawyer in private practice, I also represented professional fighters. My State of Nevada hosts most of the premier boxing matches in the world. Nevada's state-of-the-art resorts provide fight venues that are unmatched in any other part of the world, and Nevadans take great pride in the historical role the State has played in boxing. The Nevada State Athletic commission is the most respected boxing commission in the world. It has led our country and the world in implementing terms of boxing safety and ethical treatment of fighters, promoters, and ringside personnel. Nevada's commission, under the outstanding direction of Marc Ratner, serves as a model for a national commission and has guided my work on this legislation. Is there a need for the establishment of a national commission patterned after Nevada's commission to regulate boxing throughout the United States? The answer is a yes. Last July, a boxer named Brad Rone fought in Utah and died at the age of 35. While Brad lived in Las Vegas, he had been banned from fighting in Nevada for more than three years. The Nevada Commission felt that he was at risk of getting seriously injured every time he stepped into the ring. Unfortunately, this ban didn't prevent him from fighting in other States. So despite the fact that he lost 26 consecutive fights, Brad was allowed to step into the ring in Utah to fight Billy Zumbrun. After only one uneventful round of what was to be an eight-round fight, Brad passed out and died. He wasn't knocked out. He was hit once and started to walk away and collapsed. An autopsy later revealed that Brad technically died of a heart attack, but many acknowledge that the continual physical abuse inside the ring contributed to his untimely death. Unfortunately, the rules governing professional boxing and the enforcement of those rules vary widely among States. This legislation today will help avoid future tragedies like Brad's, and ensure a vibrant future for the sport of boxing and the Nation's boxers. If this legislation had been enacted before Brad's death, it would have required that his fights be approved by a Federal Commission after either his 10th defeat or fifth consecutive knockout. This bill creates the United States Boxing Commission, USBC. The USBC will prescribe and enforce uniform regulations for professional boxing in order to protect the health and safety of boxers and ensure fairness in the sport. While it will not supercede States with higher standards, like Nevada, it will establish minimum standards and conformity for all States. The USBC will also have the ability to defer its authority to States with strong commissions when deemed appropriate. Among other things, the USBC will maintain a national computerized registry for the collection of specific information on professional boxers and boxing personnel as well as certify for each boxing match the participating boxers' medical histories. It will require sites to have both an ambulance and emergency medical personnel with resuscitation equipment continuously present. There are some places today that have only one ambulance. Once a boxer is hurt, and the ambulance takes him away, there is no remaining personnel or equipment for the other fights on the card. This poses unnecessary and sometimes fatal risks to boxers and ring personnel. The USBC will also review plans submitted by all State athletic commissions for uniformity. This uniformity will discontinue the use of forum shopping that we witnessed in 2002 with the Mike Tyson v. Lennox Lewis fight. That fight was originally scheduled to take place in Las Vegas, but the Nevada State Athletic Commission declined to grant Tyson a license to fight because of his violent behavior, both inside and outside the ring. The Association of Boxing Commissions, ABC, recommended that other State commissions honor Nevada's decision not to let Tyson fight. However, the ABC acts only as a quasi-federal agency and has no enforcement authority. Obviously, the ABC's recommendation was ignored, as Tyson was permitted to fight Lewis in Tennessee. Another important problem this legislation begins to remedy is broadcasters acting as de facto fight promoters. Broadcasters who effectively operate as promoters ought to be held to the same standards and scrutiny as traditional promoters. They should be regulated in the same manner. This is only fair. Many broadcasters control when the fighters fight, who they fight, where they fight, and how much they are paid. This is the role of the promoter, and the media companies are acting as the fighters' de facto promoters. However, despite the fact that these companies are acting as promoters, they are not regulated by boxing commissions. While traditional promoters are regulated under the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act, Ali Act, and State athletic commission laws, the media companies have been virtually free from regulation. This legislation will require the broadcaster to make certain disclosures to the USBC similar to what promoters must do. Broadcasters will have to provide to the USBC statements of fees paid and owed to promoters, copies of all contracts, and a list of the sources of income they receive from the broadcast of the match. Additionally, the bill requires the USBC to study for one year the definition of a promoter and report back to Congress their proposed revised definition, speculatively, to include broadcasters as appropriate. When Congress enacted the Ali Act, one of the main goals was to protect boxers from being unfairly treated by promoters. The Ali Act provided contractual reforms that prevented exploitive business practices that at that time allowed for coercive and lengthy contracts tying a fighter to a promoter for years. Today, many fighters are entering into promotional agreements directly with the broadcaster. Thus, in order to really give the Ali Act any weight, it is necessary that those who are conducting the business of a promoter comply with the regulations set forth in the Ali Act. The broadcasters should not evade the restrictions placed on promoters by the Ali Act simply by slipping through some technical loopholes. The USBC should focus on two particular issues when making this important promoters decision. Both, I believe, strongly suggest that broadcasters be included in the promoter definition. First, it should examine the situation that exists when a broadcaster or network hires another individual or entity as the per se ``promoter'' to stage a boxing event. While the broadcaster pays this local promoter a fee, the broadcaster contracts to retain the boxer's rights to the fight, for example, the right to sell, distribute, exhibit, or license the match or in some cases several matches, and retains the right to choose dates, sites, and opponents. In this scenario, the broadcaster is really acting as a de facto promoter and should be subject to the regulations and disclosure requirements imposed by the Ali Act. However, since the local promoter is contractually charged with complying with federal and state laws, he is the only one required under current law to file financial disclosures with the boxer. The broadcaster who hires this local promoter does not have to disclose to the fighter how much the broadcaster is earning for the fight. Since conventional promoters determine when a fighter fights, where he fights, who he fights and how much he is paid, the broadcaster is doing all the work of a promoter yet circumventing the requirements of the Ali Act. It is the fighter who is left in the dark. This situation I have described is illustrated by the roles of HBO and Showtime in the Lennox Lewis vs. Mike Tyson fight. Lewis was under contract to HBO and Tyson was under contract to Showtime. These two media companies signed an agreement to promote the Lewis/Tyson fight and a possible rematch. However, neither HBO nor Showtime was required to file their agreements with the two fighters or with a State athletic commission since they are not technically ``promoters'' under the Ali Act. Instead, they hired a local promoter to ``stage'' the fight, and because the local promoter was not a party to the master agreements for the fight, those agreements may have never been filed with the commission. Furthermore, the disclosures under the Ali Act which require a promoter to inform the fighters how much revenue is to be earned by it from the event may not necessarily have been provided since the ``promoter'' was only being paid a fee to stage the fight. Oftentimes, the ``multi-fight'' agreements which these broadcasters have with their fighters may contain terms beyond those permitted by law to promoters. The second scenario the commission should examine is where the broadcaster contracts directly with the boxer or with the boxer's representative. By ``boxer's representative'' I am talking about any entity or company that employs the boxer or to whom the boxer has transferred the rights to his boxing services. Even if a broadcaster only obtains rights to the boxer through this entity, the broadcaster should still be deemed a promoter and be subject to the Ali Act because in essence, they are contracting with the boxer. Here is an example. When Tyson and Lewis fought, HBO contracted with Lion Promotions. Lion Promotions is--for all practical purposes--Lewis's company, yet legally, Lewis may or may not own or be employed by Lion Promotions. However, when HBO contracted with Lyon, they effectively contracted with Lewis directly. Thus, the contractual protections given the boxer in the Ali Act should apply in this type of situation. In determining whether a broadcaster is acting as a de facto promoter, the USBC must study the contracts between broadcasters and such entities and any attached ratifications by the boxer him/herself; the contracts with local promoters; the contracts between the local promoters and the boxer; and the contracts between any involved broadcasters. The USBC is also directed to look at the sources of income received from the broadcast of a fight and examine the amounts received from each of these sources. Effectively defining the role of a promoter requires looking at who is contracting with a boxer for the rights to the boxer's service. These rights include the rights to sell, grant, convey, distribute, exhibit, and license the match or matches. Conventional promoters control the rights to a fighter's boxing career and the right to exploit the boxer's name and image in connection with his/her boxing matches. By determining who is circumventing the requirements placed on a promoter under the Ali Act and thereafter including them within the definition of a promoter, the USBC will protect the fighter from exploitive business practices, regardless of the source. It is envisioned that the commission created under this legislation, the USBC, will monitor the boxing world, creating an environment that will enable both the sport and its participants to thrive. I am proud of the work that Senator McCain and I have done to help in the reform of this great sport.|108900|030210|2|Scr10fe03-18 1.txt|18|18|S2115|35|6|NA|Speaker|NA|NA|N/A

10820030051785|Mr. President, this amendment attempts to solve a problem facing not this generation of military leadership but our future generation of military leadership. Current law established in the Career Compensation Act of 1949 denies cadets and midshipmen the disability benefits that would be provided to any other member of the Armed Forces, especially when they are injured in the line of duty. With respect to health benefits, cadets and midshipmen who are separated for medical disability after being injured during military training now face unnecessary and unfair burdens in maintaining the continuity of their health care. In addition, Reserve Officer Training Corps, ROTC cadets are in many cases required to pay for their own medical care after being injured during military training. Even though ROTC cadets are covered under the Office of Workers Compensation within the Department of Labor, medical care providers, many of whom have not been compensated for their prior work, decline to treat ROTC patients unless they use private medical insurance. This is not something that we should allow to remain a problem. In 2001, when I became aware of the plight of some seriously disabled cadets and midshipmen from the service academies, I asked for a study. These cadets were discharged from the Armed Forces without any entitlement to future medical care or disability benefits. In each of these cases, the cadets and midshipmen had been injured in the line of duty. I asked for a report, and the Department of Defense did find that the ROTC also had examples of how the health care system, which currently operates under the Department of Labor, does not adequately serve these former cadets whose care was under their charge. In one case, a ROTC cadet received dental injuries during training at the Fort Lewis advanced camp for the U.S. Army. As a result of his injuries, he received emergency medical treatment at Fort Lewis but required followup treatment at a civilian treatment facility. The only dentist who would see the cadet treated him and received $13 on the $1,200 bill that was submitted. The dentist attempted to work in conjunction with the cadet and the ROTC unit for nearly a year to receive full payment for his work, and he never did. So the amendment I offer today would include academy cadets and midshipmen in the military disability discharge and retirement system so that they can also receive necessary health and dental benefits, and for ROTC cadets it would transfer responsibility for medical claims from the Department of Labor to the Department of Defense, authorizing the use of supplemental health care programs in the TRICARE management agency. While no additional benefits would be provided to ROTC participants, the change would ensure a better quality of health care. This amendment is fair to academy cadets, midshipmen, and ROTC cadets who are injured while in the performance of military training. It would provide health and disability benefits to those who currently receive none if they are midshipmen and academy cadets. It also ensures a credible health care system widely accepted by health care providers for those currently covered under the less effective OWC program. The Congressional Budget Office and Department of Defense estimate these changes will cost approximately $460,000 a year. So this is a very small amount of money required to provide care for those who are in training to serve our country. The bottom line is these ROTC cadets who are injured in military training would be able to receive health care if they need it as a followup, after the emergency treatment from that training accident. This provides that they can go from the Department of Labor to the Department of Defense to receive better quality and more experienced health care coverage. Regarding those midshipmen and cadets in our military academies, it would allow those who have to be severed from the academies because of their injuries, because they are no longer physically able to become members of the armed services, if they are injured in military training, that they would be able to receive the health care and the disability payments to which they would be entitled. It would go to the Veterans Affairs Department for them to determine what kind of disability and how much of a disability, just as those in the armed services do today. I think it is the fair thing. It is the result of a study that I requested. So I believe it is my responsibility to try to correct the problems that were found in the study and treat these young ROTC cadets and those wonderful young people who are in our military academies and in the Naval Academy and Coast Guard--that they would also be able to receive health care if they are injured and would be able to receive a disability payment if they are severed from the academy. I ask at the appropriate time I have a vote on my amendment.|108011|030318|1|Scr18mr03-189 1.txt|16|18|S3910|162|26|AK|Lisa Murkowski|S|NA|Republican

10820030060218|Mr. President, the Select Committee on Intelligence conducted a review in 2001 of United States assistance to Peruvian counter-drug air interdiction efforts, following the mistaken shootdown of a civilian aircraft by the Peruvian Air Force in that same year. The committee prepared a report in which it made factual findings detailing the shortcomings that led to this tragic incident. The committee report made a number of recommendations about requirements that should precede further U.S. assistance to a foreign government engaged in a program of interdicting drug trafficking aircraft. The United States Department of Justice is now conducting an investigation of the involvement of U.S. government officials in the Peruvian counter-narcotics air interdiction program, which has been operating since 1995. During that time the Senate Intelligence Committee has had oversight jurisdiction. As part of that investigation, the Justice Department is reviewing the testimony and briefings that CIA personnel gave to the congressional oversight committees, including the Senate Intelligence Committee, from the inception of the air interdiction program. To assist the Justice Department in its investigation, this resolution would authorize the chair and vice chair, acting jointly, to provide to the Justice Department, under appropriate security procedures, committee hearing transcripts and other committee records pertinent to its oversight of the Peruvian counter-narcotics air interdiction program.|108900|030514|388|Scr14my03-140 1.txt|7041|7041|S6148-S6226|24|4|NA|Speaker|NA|NA|N/A

10820030074201|Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of Karen Tandy's nomination to be Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. I am pleased that the Senate confirmed her nomination last night. I had an opportunity to meet with Ms. Tandy a few weeks ago in my office and I was quite impressed by her. With more than a quarter century of experience in drug enforcement, I believe that she is not only well qualified to be the DEA Administrator, but that she will also bring a passion for drug policy to the job. Both in her work as a prosecutor and in leadership positions at the Justice Department, Ms. Tandy's focus has been on drug trafficking, money laundering and asset forfeiture. She has served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Virginia and Washington State, Chief of Litigation in the Asset Forfeiture Office and Deputy Chief of the Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Section at Main Justice. For the past 4 years she has served as Associate Deputy Attorney General and the Director of the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force program. During that time she has focused the OCDETF program and provided tremendous leadership. Her nomination has the endorsement of a number of well-respected organizations including the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Troopers Association, the Association of Former Narcotics Agents, the National Narcotics Officers' Association Coalition, the Community Anti- Drug Coalitions of America, the County Executives of America, and the International Union of Police Associations. Ms. Tandy comes to the DEA at a time when both Federal and State resources for drug investigations are shrinking. I believe that she will have a difficult time fighting for scarce resources and keeping the drug issue on the national agenda. After September 11, the FBI transferred 567 agents from counterdrug investigation to counter-terrorism investigations and the DEA was left to fill in the gap without adequate funding. The President's 2004 budget only provides funding for an additional 233 Special Agents. By shutting down popular programs such as the Mobile and Regional Enforcement Teams, DEA has been able to shuffle around 362 agents, making them look like new agents when they are not. The magnitude of the gap left by the FBI is quite troubling. According to a recent GAO report, the number of FBI Agents working on drug cases has decreased by more than 62 percent, from 891 to 335, since September 2001. And the number of new FBI drug cases has plummeted from 1,825 in fiscal year 2000 to only 310 in the first half of fiscal year 2003. It is clear that the DEA will need more resources if it is expected to fill the sizeable void left by the FBI. That is why I joined with twelve other Senators to write to the appropriators urging that they provide more money for the DEA to be able to do its job. I hope that at the end of the day the Congress will be able to give them more money than the President requested. Another issue which relates closely to the work of the DEA, is the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act, legislation which I authored that became law as part of the PROTECT Act in April. The bill provides Federal prosecutors the tools needed to combat the manufacture, distribution or use of any controlled substance at any venue whose purpose is to engage in illegal narcotics activity. Rather than create a new law, it merely amends a well-established statute to make clear that anyone who knowingly and intentionally uses their property--or allows another person to use their property--for the purpose of distributing or manufacturing or using illegal drugs can be held accountable, regardless of whether the drug use is ongoing or occurs at a single event. I introduced this legislation after holding a series of hearings regarding the dangers of Ecstasy and the rampant drug promotion associated with some raves. For the past few years Federal prosecutors have been using the so-called ``crack house statute''--a law which makes it illegal for someone to knowingly and intentionally hold an event for the purpose of drug use, distribution or manufacturing--to prosecute rogue rave promoters who profit off of putting kids at risk. My bill simply amended that existing law in two ways. First, it made the ``crack house statute'' apply not just to ongoing drug distribution operations, but to ``single-event'' activities, including an event where the promoter has as his primary purpose the sale of Ecstasy or other illegal drugs. And second, it made the law apply to outdoor as well as indoor activity. Although this legislation grew out of the problems identified at raves, the criminal and civil penalties in the bill would also apply to people who promoted any type of event for the purpose of illegal drug manufacturing, sale, or use. This said, it is important to recognize that this legislation is not designed in any way, shape or form to hamper the activities of legitimate event promoters. If rave promoters and sponsors operate such events as they are so often advertised--as places for peopled to come dance in a safe, drug-free environment--then they have nothing to fear from this law. In no way is this bill aimed at stifling any type of music or expression--it is only trying to deter illicit drug use and protect kids. I know that there will always be certain people who will bring drugs into musical or other events and use them without the knowledge or permission of the promoter or club owner. This is not the type of activity that my bill addresses. The purpose of my legislation is not to prosecute legitimate law-abiding managers of stadiums, arenas, performing arts centers, licensed beverage facilities and other venues because of incidental drug use at their events. In fact, when crafting this legislation, I took steps to ensure that it did not capture such cases. My bill would help in the prosecution of rogue promoters who intentionally hold the event for the purpose of illegal drug use or distribution. That is quite a high bar. I am committed to making sure that this law is enforced properly and have been in close contact with officials from the Drug Enforcement Administration to make sure that the law is properly construed. That is why I was concerned by press reports about a DEA Agent in Billings, Montana who misinterpreted the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act when he approached the manager of the local Eagles Lodge to warn her that she may be violating the new law if the Lodge allowed the National Organization to Reform Marijuana Laws to have a fundraiser at their facility. I was troubled to hear this because, according to press reports, the Eagles Lodge had no knowledge that there might be drug activity at their location before the DEA approached them. And following the DEA Agent's misguided advice based on an inaccurate understanding of the law, the Lodge decided to cancel the NORML event, leading to an outcry from various groups that the new law has stifled free speech. As I mentioned, the law only applies to those who ``knowingly and intentionally'' hold an event ``for the purpose of'' drug manufacturing, sale and use. Based upon my understanding of the facts around the NORML fundraising incident, the Eagles Lodge did not come anywhere close to violating that high legal standard. I had my staff meet with the DEA chief counsel's office to discuss the Eagles Lodge incident and DEA's interpretation of the law. The DEA assured my office that they shared my understanding of the law and that this interpretation of the statute was conveyed to all DEA field offices shortly after the bill was signed into law. In a June 19, 2003, letter to me from DEA Acting Administrator William B. Simpkins, the DEA acknowledged that the Special Agent ``misinterpreted'' DEA's initial legal guidance on the law and ``incorrectly'' suggested to the Eagles Lodge that the law might apply to the NORML fundraiser. DEA conceded that ``[r]egrettably, the DEA Special Agent's incorrect interpretation of the statute contributed to the decision of the Eagles Lodge to cancel the event.'' In response to this misguided interpretation of the law, the DEA issued on June 17, 2003, supplemental guidance in a memo to all DEA field agents making clear that: I have expressed clearly to Ms. Tandy my expectation that the law will be applied narrowly and responsibly. Ms. Tandy has confirmed that under her direction the DEA will implement the law as it was intended, targeting only those events whose promoters knowingly and intentionally allow the manufacture, sale or use of illegal drugs. In the DEA's June 19, 2003 letter to me, it noted that its initial May 15, 2003 guidance: Obviously, DEA's May 15th guidance was not sufficient to prevent the unfortunate Eagles Lodge incident but it reveals the Agency's understanding and intent not to target and prosecute the sorts of legitimate businesses cited above. As this is a new law, Ms. Tandy agrees that DEA must and will redouble its efforts in training its agents on the proper legal interpretation. Finally, let me conclude by making two final responses to some critics of my law who have claimed; one, that it stretches the law beyond its original intention, and two, that it creates a legal standard that will permit innocent businessmen, concert promoters, even homeowners to be prosecuted for the drug use of those who come to their property. Both charges are wrong, as I will now explain. First, my law amended section 856 of Title 21, U.S. Code. Section 856 became law in 1986. While section 856 has become known popularly as the ``crack house statute,'' it has always been available to prosecute any venue--not just crack houses--where the owner knowingly and intentionally made the property available for the purpose of illegal drug activity. This fact has long been recognized by the Federal courts. As the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals--the most liberal Federal appellate court in the Nation--said: ``There is no reason to believe that [section 856] was intended to apply only to storage facilities and crack houses.'' [United States v. Tamez, 941 F.2d 770, 773 .] Or, in the words of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals: ``it is highly unlikely that anyone would openly maintain a place for the purpose of manufacturing and distributing cocaine without some sort of `legitimate' cover--as a residence, a nightclub, a retail business, or a storage barn.'' [United States v. Roberts, 913 F.2d 211, .] The suggestion by some that my law expanded section 856 to entities other than traditional crack houses is simply untrue. Rather, in the 17 years section 856 has been on the books, it has been used by the Justice Department to prosecute seemingly ``legitimate businesses'' used as a front for drug activity. Specifically, section 856 has been used against motels, bars, restaurants, used car dealerships, apartments, private clubs, and taverns. [See United States v. Chen, 913 F.2d 183 ; United States v. Bilis, 170 F.3d 88 ; United States v. Meschack, 225 F.3d 556 ; United States v. Tamez, 941 F.2d 770 ; United States v. Roberts, 913 F.2d 211 ; United States v. Cooper, 966 F.2d 936 ; Huerd v. United States, 1993 U.S. App. LEXIS 2949 .] The bottom line is that if a defendant hides behind the front of a legitimate business, or allows a drug dealer to do so on their property, they should be held accountable. Just as the criminal law punishes the defendant who ``aids and abets''--like the getaway driver in a bank robbery ring--section 856 has always punished those who knowingly and intentionally provide a venue for others to engage in illicit drug activity. The second point I will make is that my law does not--does not-- change the well-established legal standard of section 856 which is required to secure a criminal conviction. Some critics of my law suggest that Congress just created a new, incredibly low legal threshold for prosecution under my law. In fact, it is the exact opposite. For 17 years, section 856 has required a high burden of proof, and my law does not change that standard at all. So let's get our facts straight. In order to convict a defendant under section 856, the Justice Department needs to prove 2 things beyond a reasonable doubt--the highest legal standard in our justice system. Specifically, the government must prove that the defendant one, ``knowingly and intentionally'' made their property available, and two, ``for the purpose'' of illegal drug distribution, manufacture or use. These are 2 high hurdles the government must first pass before a defendant can be convicted under section 856. Let me briefly discuss both of these legal elements. As will become quite clear, the Federal courts interpreting section 856 have consistently rejected the very broad interpretations of the statute many critics now assert will result from my law. Federal courts construing the ``knowledge'' and ``intent'' prong of section 856 have consistently held this to be a very high bar. It's not enough for a defendant to simply think, or have reason to believe, that drug use could occur on their property. Actual knowledge of future drug use, coupled with a specific intention that such use occur, is required. One Federal court discussing the knowing and intentional standard put it this way: As explained by the Federal courts, then, section 856 means what it says--the law only applies to defendants who have actual knowledge that their property will be used for drug use and who intend that very outcome. As a result, section 856 could never be used--as some critics have irresponsibly suggested--against the promoters of a rock concert whose patrons include some who are suspected of doing drugs during live music performances. In this way, section 856 is very different than other laws proposed which would impose a ``reckless'' standard-- holding, for example, a concert promoter liable where they had reason to believe that drug use might occur. For example, a bill introduced in the House would create criminal liability for anyone who ``knowingly promotes any rave, dance, music, or other entertainment event, that takes place under circumstances where the promoter knows or reasonably ought to know that a controlled substance will be used or distributed.'' I disagreed with this approach because it would have replaced the high legal standard of section 856, on the books for 17 years, with a much lower standard where a concert promoter could be prosecuted for the illicit drug activity of patrons for which the promoter had no actual knowledge. When I wrote section 856 17 years ago, I and my colleagues required actual knowledge of illicit drug activity. Actual knowledge is still the standard today. Let me now briefly discuss the second prong under section 856, the requirement that the defendant make their property available ``for the purpose'' of illicit drug activity. Again, courts have interpreted this prong in a way to ensure that section 856 cannot be used against innocent property owners where some incidental drug use occurs on their premises. One Federal court started its discussion of the purpose prong by noting that `` `purpose' is a word of common and ordinary, well understood meaning: it is `that which one sets before him to accomplish; an end, intention, or aim, object, plan, project.' '' [Chen, 913 F.2d at 189.] Thus, Federal courts have noted that Accordingly, the courts have interpreted that ``purpose prong'' of section 856 to prevent prosecution of defendants who knowingly allowed drug use on their property. In so doing, the courts have recognized that it's not enough to simply know that illicit drug activity is occurring on one's property; the property owner must be maintaining the property for that specific purpose. This is particularly true when section 856 is used against a ``non-traditional crack house,'' such as a residence or business. In fact, a federal appellate court reversed a section 856 conviction against a defendant who had allowed her son to deal drugs out of his bedroom. There was evidence that his mother, the defendant, assisted him in his drug dealing. While the court sustained her conviction under a count of aiding and abetting, it reversed her conviction under section 856, finding that while she knowingly allowed drug dealing on her property, the primary purpose of her apartment was as a residence, not as a venue for illicit drug activity. As the court observed: This analysis makes clear that section 856 cannot be used--as critics of my law claim--against a concert promoter for the incidental drug use of their patrons or against a homeowner for the incidental drug use of a guest at a backyard barbeque. Just as section 856 ``[does not] criminalize simple consumption of drugs in one's home,'' [United States v. Lancaster, 968 F.2d 1250, 1253 ], it cannot be used to prosecute innocent event promoters, venue owners, or other property owners for the incidental drug use of the patrons or guests. Here is the bottom line: Section 856 has been on the books for 17 years and I'm unaware of it ever being used to go after a concert promoter, a venue owner, or a private citizen for the incidental drug use of their patrons or guests. Why? Because, as the Federal court decisions I have briefly reviewed today show, we wrote into law a high burden of proof to make sure that innocent actors don't get prosecuted. If you don't know for example, that the guy renting your arena plans to sell drugs, you are off the hook. If you don't intend for the guy renting your arena to sell drugs, you are off the hook. And if you don't intend that the guy renting your arena do so for the specific purpose of selling drugs, you are off the hook. So let's get our facts straight here. It is just not helpful for critics of section 856 to run around screaming that the ``sky is falling,'' when it has not fallen for 17 years and has no reason to start now. As stated earlier, innocent actors have nothing to fear from this statute and I intend to monitor the enforcement of the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act closely to make sure that it is used properly. If someone uses a rave, or any other event, as a pretext to sell ecstasy to kids, they should go to jail, plain and simple. But that sad reality should not prevent responsible event promoters and venue owners around this country from putting on live music shows and other events, just because some of their patrons will inevitably use drugs. In closing, Asa Hutchinson left some big shoes to fill over at DEA, but I believe that Ms. Tandy is up to the task. And it is wonderful that she will be the first woman to head the DEA. I congratulate her on her confirmation.|108101|030731|2|Scr31jy03pt2-43 1.txt|50|387|S10605-S10608|18696|3151|DE|Joseph Biden|S|NA|Democratic

10820030074823|He also shared the circumstances with me of the State of Arkansas. When I run by the educators in Minnesota the assertion made on the Senate floor that there is a surplus of Federal funding for these programs, I get absolutely incredulous looks. I find far more concurrence with the Senator from North Dakota, who observed teachers in his State who are reaching into their own pockets for hundreds, even thousands, of dollars, who go without expenses for basic program materials, educational materials, trips to educational enrichment opportunities, and the like that cannot be funded out of regular budgets. In Minnesota, there is an estimated $250 million shortfall of special education money because of this underfunding of the Federal commitment, which I can assure my colleagues every one of those dollars would be spent swiftly and necessarily and would benefit students throughout my State if they were made available. So where these surplus dollars are that States and school districts elsewhere don't need, where the additional slots for programs such as Head Start are residing that are not being filled, I guess I would certainly like to see where that exists. I urge the Secretary of Education, if it is in fact the case, that those funds and those slots be reallocated as swiftly as possible to States like Minnesota, who need them and could benefit from them. Yes, Mr. President, my amendment exceeds the budget as it exists today. I note that when the budget for this fiscal year began, we were looking at a deficit, we were told, of about $260 billion, if memory serves me. Now we are told that we will exceed $500 billion. We are asked rhetorically where will the money come from for these expenditures. I answer rhetorically, from the same place the other $240 billion that has been added to the deficit this year will come from. And the Senator from New Hampshire is right--that will come from payments made by taxpayers in the future. But if we are going to spend $100 billion, as some experts estimate we will, over the next year in Iraq, if we are going to spend 10 percent or 15 percent of that amount in Afghanistan, if we are going to spend $15 billion to address the AIDS crisis in Africa over the next few years, as the President proposed--and those are all either necessary or very worthwhile humanitarian and strategic expenditures, but if we are talking about additional spending on the magnitude of $15 billion, $100 billion over the course of a year, how is it that we always run out of resources when it comes to children, when it comes to especially schoolchildren with special needs, when it comes to those who will be left behind in Minnesota and I suspect will be left behind in 49 other States if these additional resources are not provided? I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for the opportunity to offer this amendment. I hope it will be considered in the broader context of the priorities of this body for the children of today and tomorrow. I respectfully suggest it is money that will be extremely well spent.

10820030085724|Mr. President, I rise today to give the Senate an update on the wildfires sweeping across Southern California--as the Senate continues to debate legislation to change our Nation's forest policy. The situation in my State is at a critical juncture. If the weather continues to improve--as it is expected--then firefighters may be able to get a handle on the fires which continue to burn. This would be good news indeed. I would also like to report that FEMA will shortly be announcing 6 permanent field sites where victims of the fire can go for assistance and 4 additional mobile sites. It is critical that the FEMA centers get opened as soon as possible-- so that the help gets where it is needed most. There are nine large fires currently raging in the State--all of which have caused considerable damage. In total, these fires have burned over 650,000 acres--about the size of Rhode Island. Twenty people have been killed. This includes a firefighter from Marin County who was killed by a fast moving wall of fire associated with the Cedar fire. Twenty-four hundred homes have been lost in five counties, and thousands more structures have been burned. There are some 13,000 firefighters waging a battle against the fires. True to form, these firefighters have given everything they have to put out the fires and are exhausted. Our thoughts and our prayers go out to these men and women--and to the family of the firefighter who died--we know that these firefighters are doing everything possible to save lives, homes, and private property. Let me now go through some of the fires to let you know what is happening. The Cedar Fire in San Diego has become the largest wildfire in California history. It has burned 250,000 acres--and 6 days old, it is only 15 percent contained. Thus far, 22 injuries have been reported as a result of this fire, and 7 civilian fatalities confirmed by the San Diego Sheriff's Department. Additionally, 1,300 Structures have been destroyed. The fire has destroyed 90 percent of the town of Cuyamaca, and today, it threatens the communities of Pine Hills, Mt. Laguna, Ramona and Julian. Plans to aggressively protect the historic town of Julian are in place. Overnight, 300 structures were destroyed in Cuyamaca and Harrison. The Old Fire in San Bernardino is also burning out of control and continues to pose a major threat to Lake Arrowhead, Big Bear, and other mountain communities. This fire also began 6 days ago. It has consumed 60,000 acres thus far and is only 10 percent contained. Massive resources have been expended to fight this fire, including 2,175 firefighters, 10 helicopters, 40 fire crews, 280 engines, and 7 air tankers. There have been three injuries to date and two civilian deaths. Conservative estimates suggest that 550 residential structures and 10 commercial structures have been destroyed. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. There are 50,000-60,000 homes and 2,000 commercial properties in the area threatened by this fire. More than 50,000 people have been evacuated from communities like Lake Arrowhead and Big Bear. Firefighters are doing what they can to protect these communities from going up in flames, but this is difficult because of the thousands of trees killed by the Bark Beetle, which have become kindling in this fire. The Grand Prix fires also continues to rage in San Bernardino, near the community of Fontana. This fire has consumed 70,000 acres, destroyed 60 residences and 60 other structures, and has resulted in 27 injuries. This fire began 10 days ago, and is 40 percent contained. Today, 1,600 firefighters, 12 helicopters, 42 fire crews, 159 engines, and 30 bull dozers are committed to this fire. It is hoped that weather conditions will allow firefighters to get better control of this fire today. Moving North, the Simi fire threatens the community of Stevenson Ranch. The good news with this fire is that it did not move into the canyons and cut a path toward Malibu. But when the wind shifted, the fire turned toward a sub-development on the northern end of Los Angeles County. This fire has consumed 105,560 acres and destroyed 16 structures and 64 other buildings. Thus far, there have been 5 injuries as a result of this fire, and the fire is only 35 percent contained. Now, firefighters are trying to keep this fire away from homes and have thus far been successful. Today is a critical day for this fire. Cooler temperatures may allow a fire line to be completed along Potero Canyon, and this would go a long way toward bringing this fire under control. Like the other fires, massive resources have been deployed to fight this fire, including: 1,389 firefighters, 9 helicopters, 236 engines, 6 air tankers, and 27 bulldozers. The Piru fire continues to burn in Ventura county, near the community of Fillmore. Thus far, 62,000 acres have been consumed, and the fire is only 30 percent contained. The fire began a week ago, has caused 20 injures and destoyed 8 structures. But this fire remains dangerous. The fire is moving towards fuel- laden areas in the Los Padres National Forest, and we have to watch this one closely. The Padua fire--near Claremont, CA--is smaller than the other ones, but it has caused considerable damage nonetheless. Latest reports show that it has burned almost 10,000 acres, and the good news is that it is 50 percent contained. This fire has caused 15 injuries, destroyed 59 structures, and threatens 500 homes in the community of Mt. Baldy. The resources directed at this fire include 691 firefighters, 17 fire crews, 80 engines, and 4 bulldozers. Some good news from the Whitmore fire, near Shasta, CA. This fire which has burned approximately 1,000 acres is 80 percent contained. There have been no injuries as a result of this fire, and it is expected to be contained today. It is my great hope that this happens. Good news also with the Tuk Fire, 10 miles east of Orick, CA, south of Crescent City. This fire has burned only 315 acres and is 80 percent contained. Officals are hoping that this fire will be fully contained today as well. The mountain fire, which burned just under 10,000 acres in Riverside, CA, has been 100 percent contained. Fire officials will continue to complete burnout operation in near the fire edge, and pending favorable weather, should be completed soon. This fire was serious--it caused 6 injuries and 61 structures. Fire crews and equipment are coming in from other States. The governor of New Mexico has offered equipment, and I understand that other States have offered help as well. As crews become weary and fatigued, it will be increasingly important to get reinforcements from other States--and I will do what I can to make sure this happens. In terms of victim assistance, help is on its way. As I mentioned, FEMA will be establishing four permanent centers in affected communities, and four mobile centers. Additionally, if any Californian needs help, they can call my San Diego or Los Angeles office, and we will do anything we can to ensure that they get the appropriate assistance. This is a terrible time for Californians, but in times of crisis, people pull together and do what they can to help one another. It is my hope that these fires can be quickly contained--with limited casualties and loss of property. This event has truly been a wake up call, and I hope that we learn how critical it is to manage our lands, to ensure that catastrophic fires like these can be prevented.|108083|031030|1|Scr30oc03pt2-48 1.txt|16|149|S13651-S13652|7458|1269|CA|Dianne Feinstein|S|NA|Democratic
10820030085922|Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue within the Appropriations Committee's jurisdiction, which is the subcommittee that I chair, the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary, and a letter sent to the committee as a result of the mark which came out of the full committee markup process funding those major agencies. This subcommittee has very broad jurisdiction. It is an exciting committee, quite honestly, of which to be chairman. It has the Commerce Department, it has the Justice Department, it has Judiciary, the FTC, FCC, and a number of other major agencies, including State Department. As a result of the allocation process, which is a process by which the chairman of the full committee assigns each of the 13 subcommittees within the Appropriations Committee an amount of money they can spend on the various agencies which they have responsibility for, which amount is tied to the overall budget passed by the Senate, so that the overall budget, which I believe was $784 billion, is chopped into parts and each subcommittee gets a part of that budget which it then allocates to the various agencies for which it has responsibility. As a result of that process, this subcommittee, the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary, was the only subcommittee which actually received less of an allocation. In other words, our number that we had for our agencies was less than what, first, the President requested by, I believe, $700 million, and, second, what the House had allocated to this same group of agencies by $900 million. Our subcommittee, when it was assigned our number, was almost $1 billion below the amount which was available to the House subcommittee and even more significantly below what the President had requested for these agencies. That was a responsibility I was willing to accept. I am happy to try to do my job around here. If my job involves being fiscally responsible, I am more than happy to do that. So when the chairman made this decision, which was a reasonable decision in light of the very stringent numbers he had to work with, I worked with them and produced a bill which met those numbers. Our bill came out at a funding level which was significantly below the House number. A number of the agencies which were impacted obviously were not happy about that. Most of them, however, were sophisticated enough to realize that in the end there was going to be a compromise between our committee and the House committee and that I suspect our number will move up closer to the House number and, therefore, closer to the President's number. Most of the other agencies were fairly responsible in their reaction to this, fairly reserved. For example, we received a letter from the Justice Department, which took many of the major cuts--not cuts but reductions in increases--that I had to make. This letter was a very matter of fact, accurate statement of where they thought they needed more money. I cannot argue with their position. In fact, in many ways, if I have more money as we move down the road, I will address those concerns very aggressively: for example, in the areas of the FBI, ATF, DEA, and general operations of the Justice Department. These were reasonable objections. They disagreed with our funding levels, but the Attorney General understood that we had a problem. Then we received a letter from the State Department. Now, the State Department is supposed to be diplomatic. I believe that should be one of their skills. This was not a diplomatic letter. It was excessive, inaccurate, and inflammatory. It essentially attacked the Appropriations Committee and the subcommittee in terms which I thought were grossly overstated and inappropriate. In it, the Department questioned our commitment to national security, questioned our commitment to the State Department, and then went on to raise specific problems with the bill that were not dollar related, for the most part, but were policy related, many of which were actually policy initiatives that the State Department knew or had to know were inaccurate. They based an inflammatory letter on facts which were wrong. I am going to go through that letter, point by point, and address those issues. I am not going to address the overall funding issue too much because this gets into my allocation, the allocation we received, and down the road we will be able to address that. Down the road, we will be able to address that. But that was not really the essence of this letter. This letter was a very vitriolic attack on the Appropriations Committee, regrettably, by the Secretary of State, signed by the Secretary of State, and I think it has to be responded to. I am going to try to do it in a matter-of-fact way. I am not going to raise my language to the level he raised his because I think his level was inappropriate and extraordinarily undiplomatic. But let me pursue the specifics. The Department's--when I say ``Department,'' I am referring, of course, to the State Department. The Department's appeal letter criticizes the bill for not providing full funding for the Diplomatic Readiness Initiative. The Diplomatic Readiness Initiative is the State Department's plan to hire 1,158 new Foreign Service officers over 3 years. The $97 million requested in fiscal year 2004 represents the third and final year of funding for this unprecedented hiring surge. The Department's target levels, both in terms of funding and personnel, for the Diplomatic Readiness Initiative were arrived at in a rather arbitrary way, in our opinion. State never undertook a comprehensive review to determine where and how many additional staff might be needed. In fiscal year 2002, the committee asked the Department to provide justification for the requested 1,158 new hires. The committee repeated that request, and the request went unanswered. The committee, this year, asked the State Department to explain where the 399 new Foreign Service officers, requested in fiscal year 2004, would be stationed--What bureaus? What embassies?--a fairly reasonable request from the appropriations committee charged with protecting the pocketbooks of American taxpayers. The State Department could not answer the question. If any internal review process had taken place to determine the proper personnel levels for overseas posts, the Department would have easily been able to tell the committee where these new FSOs would be placed, but they could not. The problem concerning the Diplomatic Readiness Initiative goes hand in hand with the issue of right-sizing. ``Right-sizing'' refers to the configuration of U.S. Government overseas personnel to the minimum necessary to support national interests. According to the General Accounting Office--this is not our committee--but according to a General Accounting Office report, the State Department ``has no comprehensive process in place for developing the staffing projections that are essential to the right-sizing process.'' In its appeal letter, the Department states that this claim is ``no longer accurate.'' But the Department's very use of the words ``no longer'' is an admission it did not, in fact, have a right-sizing process in place when the Diplomatic Readiness Initiative was put forward. In the absence of any indicators that State has undertaken right- sizing on its own, the committee decided to include two provisions that would compel the State Department to right-size downward, hopefully, two posts in Western Europe. For the sake of argument, however, let us assume that State was, in fact, able to justify its Diplomatic Readiness Initiative requests and that it did have an effective right-sizing program in place. The Department's letter claims that the bill provides only $67.4 million for the Diplomatic Hiring Initiative. That simply is not true. It is not accurate, like much else in this letter. The Senate report clearly states that $90 million is available for the Diplomatic Readiness Initiative. The State Department is dissatisfied because the committee considers its request for 68 new consular officers to be part of the diplomatic readiness, not an add-on. In fiscal year 2004, the State Department requested 68 new consular officers in addition to the final tranches of 399 new Foreign Service Officers. State claims the increase is necessary due to unanticipated personnel needs. The last-minute addition of the 68 new FTEs, at a cost of $22.6 million, confirms the committee's suspicion that the Department, in fact, had not undertaken any meaningful workforce planning. The second point the Department makes here: the Department's appeal letter criticizes the bill for not providing any funding for the Bureau of Legislative Affairs, or ``H'', as it is commonly known. For the sake of full disclosure, it should be noted that the Bureau of Legislative Affairs wrote the letter that was sent to us by the State Department, which I think, on its face, should explain why we zeroed it out. But I will go into more specifics. The House bill contains language capping both the funding and the personnel of that Bureau. Why would both the House and the Senate Appropriations Committees move to limit or, in our case, strike the office's funding? The reality is that both House and Senate appropriators are unhappy with the performance of this office and are unconvinced of its necessity. There are currently 69 full-time equivalents at H at an annual cost of $7.7 million. The Senate CJS Subcommittee works almost exclusively with the State Department's budget office, not the Bureau of Legislative Affairs. In the interest of fairness to my House and Senate colleagues who might utilize the H Department, I would consider reducing the Bureau of Legislative Affairs' budget by one-quarter to account for the services that are not provided to our subcommittee but for which we seem to be paying. And possibly the House will take the same position. That would allow, of course, H to be able to work with the authorizing committees and other Congressional offices. So we are willing to adjust there. But I think people can understand why, after I complete my analysis of this letter, this Bureau does not merit funding from the committee. The Department appeal letter also criticizes the bill for not providing any funding for the Office of Legal Adviser, or ``L'', as it is commonly known. As the letter points out, the committee certainly does not believe the State Department's legal needs should go uncovered. Situations will undoubtedly arise that will require a legal response from the Department of State. This is why the committee would likely have moved in conference to restore at least a portion of this office's funding, and we will do that. The committee did not provide funding for L in fiscal year 2004 to make a point as to the failures of L's performance in a number of areas. This office has several times overstepped its bounds. The Office of Legal Adviser is responsible for providing timely legal advice and support to the Secretary of State. However, L regularly inserts itself into the policymaking process, even to the point of telling the Congress what the Congress does and does not intend by the laws we pass. With all due respect to the good people who work at L, Senator Hollings and I and other members of the Appropriations Committee really are not interested in having State Department lawyers tell us what we meant when we passed laws. This is exactly, however, what L did when Senator Hollings tried to pass legislation allowing Americans who were held hostage during the Iranian hostage crisis to file claims for damages against Iran. Whether my colleagues agree or disagree with Senator Hollings' position--and it has been a position of some controversy--on this particular issue there can be no disagreement over the Office of Legal Adviser's slick lobbying tactics and outright refusal to follow the congressional direction. Another source of frustration is L's past attempts to withhold information from the committee. An April, 2003, Department of State Inspector General's report described the case of a State Department employee who was committing fraud against the Department. The IG report did not clarify the outcome of the case, stating only that the employee had been recommended for removal. As an oversight responsibility, we inquired as to whether the person had been removed or not. L directed the Legislative Affairs Office not to provide this information to the committee on the basis that it had Privacy Act protection. I believe the American people, and certainly the appropriations committee, have a right to know whether or not a person accused of fraud by the IG has been removed from that office. The American people have a right to know whether an employee caught stealing their tax dollars remains on the Federal payroll. So, the committee reiterated its request. At that point, the State Department told the committee what we already knew to be true: that the Privacy Act contains a statutory waiver for congressional committees of jurisdiction. State then told the committee it could have the information only if it could produce a letter of request. However, the statutory waiver contains no mention of a letter. We refused to sign a letter and gave the State Department a deadline to make the information available to the committee. This was many months ago, and we are still waiting for the information. A congressional committee of jurisdiction should not be at the mercy of the State Department's legal department and its internal rules for access to information. Such rules are obviously intended to withhold information from the American people that could potentially embarrass the State Department. It is regrettable that the Office of Legal Adviser can so flagrantly defy the wisdom, the spirit, and the intent of a waiver for congressional committees of jurisdiction. The Department's appeal letter further criticizes the bill for not providing funding for the Office of Brazilian/Southern Cone Affairs and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for that office. There is a very straightforward reason for the committee's decision not to provide funding for this office. In 2002, the Department decided to consolidate the Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, operations into leased facilities rather than construct a new consulate building. This decision left the Department holding several properties in Rio de Janeiro that it could not sell due to the 1991 Brazilian law that requires individuals and businesses to be current on their Social Security payments to the Government of Brazil before they can legally transfer property title. In 1996, the State Department discontinued the payment of employer contributions into the Brazilian Social Security system for foreign service national employees because the Department deemed the Brazilian Social Security system to be fiscally unsound. The Department deemed it to be fiscally unsound. The Department set up its own pension system for the FSNs. The result of this is that the United States now owes approximately $10 million in arrears to the Government of Brazil. The State Department had in the past refused to pay the arrears. The committee supported its decision not to do so because we had already paid that $10 million in two accounts to benefit these employers. However, when the Department eventually needed to dispose of the property in Rio de Janeiro, it requested a reprogramming of $10 million to repay the arrears. The committee denied the Department's request, citing the principle of the matter and the fact that American taxpayers were, in essence, being asked to pay twice for these FSN pensions. Shortly thereafter, it was brought to the committee's attention that certain officials from the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs were trying to arrange a property swap with the Government of Brazil. In other words, the committee specifically told the Department not to pay back the arrears, and the Bureau sought a way around the committee's denial of the funding. In light of these inexcusable actions and in light of the low fiscal year 2004 allocation, the committee decided that the appropriate funding level for the Office of Brazilian/Southern Cone Affairs was zero. The bill makes it clear that even the Department of State is accountable for the expenditure of the American taxpayers' dollars. The Department's appeal letter further criticizes the bill for not providing funds for the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs. It is the responsibility of this bureau to promote U.S. interests in oceans, manage fish resources, protect marine environment through treaties, and promote U.S. interests in the international management of fresh water, forests, hazardous chemicals, and the atmosphere. Why would anyone want to abolish an office with such an important portfolio? The answer is that OES is not really getting the job done. The people at OES are very skilled diplomats, but they are not using their talents to negotiate effective, forceful treaties on fisheries, forests, and the atmosphere. They are instead burning time and talent lobbying for more resources for themselves or trying to wriggle out of initiatives which Congress has asked them to undertake. For the record, the bill does not abolish the OES functions, as some have accused. The bill transfers all of the OES's oceans-related responsibilities to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That seems reasonable. The bill does not reassign many of OES's other core functions, such as climate change, deforestation, et cetera. This is because the Commerce, Justice, State Subcommittee does not have jurisdiction over the agencies responsible for these activities. It is not our place to say that the EPA Administrator should negotiate climate change treaties on behalf of the United States since the State Department can't seem to manage to do it. The committee has received quiet praise from a range of groups, from industry to NGOs, on the elimination of this office. These groups share our frustration with the OES's inability, and sometimes unwillingness, to do its job in what we consider to be an effective manner and have congratulated the committee on its decision to move OES functions to agencies that actually care about and have expertise in issues such as endangered turtles, lumber imports, and global climate change. What is the root of the committee's frustration with the OES? OES has contravened statutory requirements to seek binding international treaties on endangered sea turtles and shark finning. On trade issues, OES has consistently pressed a U.S. position that sacrifices the environmental and conservation agenda. It is important to note that things were no better under prior administrations. Finally, there is widespread frustration with the lack of expertise and institutional knowledge of the OES negotiators due to State's policy of constantly rotating Foreign Service officers. Simply put, the committee got tired of being ignored by OES, and the Congress should also be tired of this. This year, the committee decided to take action. The action taken was constructive. It reassigned these important functions to people who actually understand the issues and who are willing to pursue them. Further, the State Department's appeal letter objects to the bill's inclusion of $52 million for the Center for Anti-Terrorism and Security Training. The CAST facility would allow the Department to consolidate training for the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Anti-Terrorism Assistance Program. The Department requested $52 million for this project in fiscal year 2003. The House objected, and the Department ultimately did not receive the funding last year. In light of this, the committee included the $52 million in fiscal year 2004. It was assumed that if the Department had requested the funds in fiscal year 2003 it would then want them to be included in the fiscal year 2004 funding. However, the Department's appeal letter objects to their inclusion this year. The State Department's inconsistency on this matter leads one to seriously question the processes by which it determines its budgetary priorities. In my humble opinion, they do need a center where they are able to train their Bureau of Diplomatic Security people, who have expanded radically in number over the last few years. State's inconsistency on this matter is hard to understand. State's complaints about the decisions of this committee are rather bold, given this inconsistency. The Department's appeal letter next objects to the bill's inclusion of $40 million for security enhancements for so-called soft targets. These funds are intended to be used to pay for security enhancements such as guards, shatter-resistant windows, emergency warning systems, and bollards at staff housing and American schools overseas. I started this initiative in the fiscal year 2003 budget. A total $15 million was included in that bill, along with language drawing particular attention to the security needs of our overseas schools. Or at least I thought $15 million was included in the bill. The State Department has recently informed the committee that it has chosen to interpret this figure as $15 million over 3 years, not $15 million for each of 3 years as the committee intended. And since the actual funding level for the soft target initiative will fall $10 million below what was envisioned for fiscal year 2003, the fiscal year 2004 level will have to be at least $25 million to meet the goal. The Department has argued that $40 million is too much for this program. It is the committee's position that this is the right amount, especially since the Department appears to be playing budget games with this important initiative. It is extremely disheartening, in light of the pledges given to us by leadership at the State Department, that they would now try to decrease this funding to protect soft targets. Some of us are personally very committed to making sure that, when our Foreign Service people go overseas and take their families with them, we give those families reasonable protection. It appears the Department, perhaps, is not. The Department's appeal letter objects to the bill's inclusion of language limiting the number of personnel working in U.S. Embassies in Paris, France, and Berlin, Germany. The letter states: ``This micro- management circumvents the Department's right-sizing plan process''. The bill includes caps on personnel because, as discussed earlier, the Department has no right-sizing process in place. And our Embassies in Paris and Berlin are a living--and growing--testament to this. I addressed this problem of right-sizing earlier, and I will not belabor the point. There are a couple of factors that led the committee to choose Paris and Berlin as the places to begin this mandatory right-sizing. The U.S. Embassy in Paris has grown so large that the post now occupies several annexes throughout the city in addition to the primary Embassy building. Recently, the Department requested to utilize $25 million to renovate a building into which personnel from other annexes could be consolidated. As if the $25 million price tag weren't bad enough, shortly after State made this request the committee discovered that the roof of the building had collapsed. State continued to push for approval of the funds to renovate the dilapidated building--right up until both the House and Senate Appropriations subcommittees denied this request. As far as Berlin is concerned, the committee had originally been told that the new embassy building planned for the historic Pariser Platz site would have to be smaller than normal, due to the small size of the property--about 1.5 acres. This is how State justified to the committee the cost of purchasing and renovating an ample new consular compound in Frankfurt, Germany. State's rationale was--and the committee agreed-- that if the embassy building in Berlin had to be smaller than necessary, some personnel could be transferred to what was to become a ``regional hub'' in Frankfurt. A little under a year ago, the State Department informed the committee that the Berlin building would actually be much larger than normal. In fact, the new embassy building envisioned for Berlin is a 24,000 square meter colossus, what the Department terms a ``special project.'' The result is that we have an enormous ``regional hub'' compound in Frankfurt and a supersized embassy building in Berlin. The convoluted history of the Berlin project leads one to question whether the State Department takes the concept of right-sizing seriously at all. The Department's letter also criticizes the bill for reducing the funding level of the Berlin project by $70 million. The Berlin project, unlike all of the other capital projects requested in fiscal year 2004, is not driven by security needs. The bill redirects this $70 million to construction of a new consulate building in Karachi, Pakistan. The design/construction phase for Karachi was not scheduled to begin until fiscal year 2005. However, given the current security situation in Pakistan, the committee felt it should begin as soon as possible. Employees of the U.S. Consulate General in Karachi have come under attack on four separate occasions during the last decade. On two such occasions, the consulate building itself was attacked. The most recent attack occurred in February, 2003, when a gunman opened fire on the local police assigned to the consulate. In light of this, the committee decided that our consulate in Karachi was in urgent need of reconstruction. Shrinking the size of an already-too-large building in Berlin, Germany, seemed like a very reasonable price to pay for a badly needed security construction project in Pakistan. It is the committee's policy to address the security needs of our embassies and consulates overseas before constructing buildings that are desirable for historical and cultural reasons. The Department's appeal letter criticizes the bill for not providing full funding for the U.S. payment to the United Nations. The difference between the requested amount of $1 billion and the recommendation of $922 million can be explained by the committee's decision not to provide the requested funds for the United States to rejoin UNESCO. However, the Department may not be aware of this, but we have had significant discussions with the White House and members of the administration, and I fully expect we will be funding UNESCO. Another factor contributing to the ``cut'' to this account was the committee's decision not to provide the funds for the United States share of the costs of the U.N. Human Rights Commission. The House bill contains a provision that would withhold funds for this U.N. body as well. The U.N. Human Rights Commission is notorious because it is chaired by Libya and boasts such members as Sudan, Cuba, and Zimbabwe. Human Rights Watch this year called the U.N. Human Rights Commission: ``An abusers club of governments hostile to human rights.'' The U.N. Human Rights Commission ignores the real human rights violators. No resolution in the history of the commission has ever been passed on states such as Syria, China, Saudi Arabia or Zimbabwe. The commission has not addressed gross and systematic human rights abuses in countries such as Bahrain, Chad, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Saudi Arabia, Syria, United Arab Emirates, Yemen, and Zimbabwe. The Commission is a platform for Israel-bashing. It has spent more time on Israel than any other country. Eleven percent of its total substantive meeting time has been spent on Israel alone, while 24 percent of its time has been spent on all other U.N. states combined. Lastly and most alarmingly, the U.N. Human Rights Commission is being used as a forum for the expression of values and positions that run completely counter to America's own. One member state objected to the inclusion of language calling cross amputation ``cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment'' on the grounds that it was an offense to all Muslim countries. The Commission has also adopted a resolution affirming the legitimacy of ``all available means,'' including suicide- bombing, ``to resist foreign occupation and for self-determination.'' At one meeting, the Libyan Chairman shouted that the U.S. war against terror showed that the U.S. ``despised humanity.'' Should we stand by as American tax dollars are allowed to flow to such an organization? The House of Representatives doesn't think so. The Senate Appropriations Committee didn't think so. Apparently, the Department of State thinks so. The last portion of the ``cut'' to this account is explained by the bill's discontinuation of funding for a number of the smaller international organizations. In the past, the committee has directed the State Department to review the list of smaller international organizations to which the United States belongs to determine which of these may no longer be worthwhile for the United States. State has not done so. This year, the committee began making eliminations. The committee gave the State Department the chance to review the list itself, but it did not act. The Department's appeal letter criticizes the bill for not providing full funding for the U.S. share of the cost of United Nations peacekeeping missions. The bill provides only $483 million for peacekeeping while the request was $550 million. This, the State Department correctly points out, is a difference of $67 million. What the Department's appeal letter does not acknowledge is that, on September 30, 2003, the committee approved a reprogramming providing that $100 million in this account would be carried forward to fiscal year 2004. The result of this? State is not going to have a $67 million shortfall, it is going to have a $33 million windfall. The State Department knew this $100 million in carryover would be available when they wrote their appeal letter. They knew that the Senate CJS bill assumed that ample carryover funding would be available. This is the most egregious part of the Department's appeal letter. It is an outright fabrication. But let's turn to the real issues. The report accompanying the fiscal year 2004 bill directs the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to complete its work by 2004 and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia to complete its work by 2006. Both ICTY and ICTR have been criticized for being slow and unprofessional, for having inadequate staff, for the passivity of their judges, and for their insufficient oversight of expenditures and employees. The Department of State itself has criticized these tribunals for their shortcomings. For these reasons, the Senate report includes language urging the U.N. to develop an exit strategy for these Tribunals. The committee's disappointment in the performance of the Yugoslavia and Rwanda Tribunals had little to do, however, with the level of funding they received . This funding decision had more to do with the fact that the bills for these 2 Tribunals--that is, the amount the U.N. assesses to the United States each year--have been much lower than anticipated for the past few years. The State Department has, for several years, budgeted about twice what it really needed to pay the U.S.'s bills for the Yugoslavia and Rwanda Tribunals. In light of this year's low allocation, we decided to hold back these funds and use them elsewhere. State recently estimated that the bills for fiscal year 2004 would come in at just around the requested level. The committee will likely adjust this level upwards in conference, since it is not interested in creating new U.S. arrears without a compelling reason. But it is important to note that the low Senate level for the Tribunals resulted from State's own budgetary ineptitude. State was quick to lash out at the committee for not providing full funding for the Yugoslavia and Rwanda War Crimes Tribunals. Yet, State itself is withholding funds for the Special Court for Sierra Leone. The Special Court is assigned the task of prosecuting those who committed atrocities during Sierra Leone's gruesome civil war. In fiscal year 2003, Congress appropriated $10 million for the Special Court. State refused to provide the entire $10 million, in a blatant disregard of congressional intent. The Chief Prosecutor for Sierra Leone has told the committee that without the additional $5 million, the Special Court may have to shut down as early as February. The Department has criticized this bill for trimming down what, in past years, was a grossly inflated budget for the U.N.-run tribunals while denies the United States- and British-led tribunals its promised funding. This inconsistency is worrisome. The Department also objects to report language under peacekeeping that directs the United Nations to develop an exit strategy for the U.N. Peacekeeping force in Cyprus. The reason for this language is simple. It is not fair for U.S. taxpayers to have to pay for missions in countries that are on the cusp of joining the European Union. The last two years have seen the U.S. take on tremendous new global responsibilities, with Afghanistan and Iraq representing the largest. The U.S. cannot afford to keep taking on new missions if its existing missions never go away. The U.N. mission to Cyprus began in 1964, 39 years ago. The State Department needs to use the U.S.' voice in the Security Council to ensure that U.N. peacekeeping missions are held to some sort of reasonable time frame. The Department also objects to the bill's failure to include language allowing it to carry over 15 percent of the fiscal year 2004 peacekeeping appropriations into fiscal year 2005. As I mentioned earlier, the peacekeeping bills have been coming in much lower than expected. In fiscal year 2004, the Department's peacekeeping appropriation was $167 million above what it actually needed. Assuming this trend continues, the Department's request to carry over 15 percent of its peacekeeping appropriations is the equivalent of an advanced appropriation, something which the subcommittee of which I am chairman has tried to avoid. As a rule, the committee does not provide advanced appropriations since they take funding decisions away from the elected representatives of the people and hand it over to the agencies. This is simply a matter of policy and proper management. The Department's appeal letter further criticizes the bill for not providing full funding for Educational and Cultural Exchanges, but the Department's appeal letter does not tell the whole story. In fiscal year 2004, the Office of Management and Budget decided to move the former Soviet exchange programs, at a cost of approximately $100 million, over to the Commerce-State-Justice Subcommittee from the Foreign Operations Subcommittee. This maneuver was intended to make room for the expanded Middle East exchange programs in the Foreign Operations budget. This was an OMB initiative. Whether or not one agrees that these programs belong in Commerce-Justice-State, there were simply not enough funds in the subcommittee's 302 allocation to absorb them. The committee has always generously supported the exchanges. They are one part of the State Department's public diplomacy program that consistently produces good results, but even the committee has to question whether, if the former Soviet exchanges are no longer a high priority area for the United States--which the administration's budget signals they are not--then their funding needs to be reduced and they need to be folded into an existing exchange program under Commerce- Justice-State. OMB and the State Department should be committed, as I am, to reprioritizing rather than simply adding more and programs. In any event, OMB should not act unilaterally, creating an impossible situation for the subcommittee given its low allocation, and then, with the State Department, write a letter complaining about it. The Department's appeal letter further objects to language in the bill designed to prevent the State Department from making a reprogramming request more than once. The committee decided to include this language after the Department requested to reprogram funding for the same project five times. In this particular instance, the committee denied the Department's request to utilize Commerce-Justice-State funding to construct two USAID annexes. The committee's position has always been that the Commerce-Justice-State Subcommittee should not have to build buildings for agencies over which it does not have any oversight. Seems reasonable to us. The USAID's operating budget does not fall under the jurisdiction of Commerce-Justice-State and, thus, this subcommittee has no way of ensuring that USAID is managing its funds wisely, that its requests for new buildings are legitimate, and that all of the personnel it places in these buildings are needed in those buildings. Moreover, separating USAID's building function from the oversight of its own appropriators-- the Foreign Operations Subcommittee--allows USAID to escape accountability for its capital program, which is not good budgeting procedure. The State Department apparently has failed to grasp this concept that when the committee says no it means no. The Department's appeal letter further objects to language in the bill requiring the Department to submit the U.N.'s budget along with its own budget to the committee. The regular dues of the United States to the U.N. are paid through the Commerce-Justice-State bill. In the fiscal year 2004, these dues will amount to $1 billion for the U.N. regular payments and $550 million for peacekeeping, for a total of $1.5 billion of American tax dollars. This amount represents almost 20 percent of the entire State Department account, yet none of these funds--none of these funds--are justified in any meaningful way or any meaningful detail to the committee. All this bill language does is allow the committee to see for what this $1.5 billion is being used. The Department's appeal letter says it would be ``impractical'' for State to submit the U.N.'s budget to the subcommittee. I don't see why. Furthermore, the Department's letter states that the fact the committee has requested to receive the U.N.'s budget ``suggests that the committee would intend to exercise oversight over the U.N. budget to the same degree that it does over other accounts in the President's budget request.'' This, of course, is preposterous and inaccurate. The committee could never exercise this kind of oversight over the U.N. budget. The U.N. is an independent international organization. The committee can't make the U.N. do anything. Only the Security Council can make the U.N. do something. All this language does is ensure the committee is able to account for the expenditures of U.S. tax dollars. The Appropriations Committee is given the responsibility by the Constitution and by the taxpayers of the United States to make sure their tax dollars are being spent effectively and to know where their tax dollars are going. It seems reasonable that we should at least get an accounting from the U.N. of how $1.5 billion is being spent, and that is all we are seeking. The State Department's appeal letter further objects to language included in the bill that provides for an automatic transfer of funding in the event of a visa fee shortfall. The Department's Border Security Program--essentially its consular operations--is funded exclusively from revenue generated through the Machine Readable Visa Fee Program. Since September 11, the number of visa applications to the United States has declined dramatically. This has created a shortfall in excess of $100 million in the Department's Border Security Program. This has obvious national security implications. The Department has been aware of this problem for more than a year now. The committee has asked the Department several times to propose a comprehensive solution to this problem. In the absence of a solution, the committee vowed to transfer funds from the Department's main operating account to cover the shortfall. Consequently, the committee included language in the fiscal year 2004 bill that provides just such a safety mechanism--an automatic transfer of funds--to ensure that funding shortfalls do not disrupt the Department's critical Border Security operation. For the record, the committee has still not received a proposal from the State Department. The Department's current ad hoc system for addressing funding shortfalls in the Border Security Program is unacceptable. The Department leaves the committee little choice but to insist that this language be carried forward in the report. The Department's appeal letter objects to language included in the bill that would withhold funds for any U.N. peacekeeping mission that places U.S. troops under the command of a foreign national. This language is part of a larger debate over the International Criminal Court. Identical language was included in last year's Commerce-Justice- State conference report, which passed both the Senate and the House. The House included identical language this year. Congress has spoken on this matter and the matter rests as it is. Why the State Department would write such an inflammatory letter now claiming that this language is inappropriate is beyond my understanding, especially given the history of this language. The Department's appeal letter objects to the language included in the report requiring the Department to demonstrate that consolidation of its payroll system would result in a savings for the American taxpayer. What an outrageous idea that we should ask the State Department to prove that something they are planning will save money, and then actually have them show us how it does save money. There is also report language requiring the Department to submit a reprogramming before it obligates any funding for payroll consolidation. Last January, the Office of Management and Budget announced an initiative to consolidate the Federal payroll system. It is estimated that this consolidation will reduce the number of agencies processing employee checks from 22 to 4, which could save the taxpayers up to $1 billion over the next 10 years. The committee is very supportive of this initiative. However, State's payroll needs are very different from the payroll needs of domestic agencies. The State Department currently pays over 25,000 Americans both domestically and overseas and over 35,000 local national employees in 180 different countries biweekly in local currencies. The purpose of this report language is to ensure that if any payroll consolidation takes place at the State Department, that State's unique needs are met. The committee has a right to exercise oversight over these funds. In fact, it is our obligation to do so, and I would think that State would encourage it rather than resist it. The Department's appeal letter objects to report language that requires the Department to move the Office of Foreign Missions out of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security to the Bureau of Management. The Office of Foreign Missions was created to review and control the operations of foreign missions in the United States and to administer the benefits available to them. The Office of Foreign Missions was originally invented as a stand-alone office under the Secretary of State. In 1996, however, the office was moved to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security. The person who was then the director of the office took OFM with him when he was appointed head of Diplomatic Security. The committee's reason for including this report language is straightforward. We have talked to several foreign ambassadors who say the Office of Foreign Missions acts as though its primary mission is to police foreign missions rather than assist them. We have even had foreign diplomats tell us that they feel as though the Office of Foreign Missions treats them like ``criminals''. This is unacceptable. I am certain this penchant for heavyhandedness can be explained by the Office of Foreign Missions' being housed in the Department's security branch. For the second year in a row, the committee has asked the Department to consider moving the office back. The language was ignored the first time and hopefully we can get it to work this time. The appeal letter objects to report language that directs the Department not to grant visas to any person caught trafficking in looted Iraqi antiquities. It objects to that language. This language says, essentially, that anyone found to be responsible for looting and damaging Iraq's historical and culturally significant works is barred from receiving a U.S. visa. U.S. visas are not a right. They are a privilege. Any person who attempts to profit from the misfortune of the Iraqi people should lose this privilege. Why the State Department opposes this is beyond us. It is especially disconcerting that the Department objects to this language in the context of an inflammatory letter that questions this committee's commitment to national security. The appeal letter objects to report language requiring that children over the age of 1 be present for the adjudication of a U.S. passport. This minor change in Department policy, though admittedly an inconvenience for passport applicants, would help prevent international child abductions. Currently, State Department regulations do not require children under the age of 14 to appear personally when passport applications are made on their behalf. As a result, passport fraud involving the substitution of photographs of one child for another is regrettably common. The committee included this language following a Department of State Inspector General's report that recommended precisely this policy change. By law, State Department bureaus are required to respond to the recommendations contained in an Inspector General's report. On July 8, 2003, the Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs sent a memo to the Inspector General stating that she not only concurs with the IG's recommendation, but is implementing it. This is good news. But one wonders why State is attacking us for suggesting it in our bill. Included in the appeal letter is an objection to report language directing the Department to construct a new office building in Kingston, Jamaica, instead of utilizing an existing building for both post housing and embassy functions. The committee was under the impression this plan also was already being implemented by the Bureau of Overseas Building Operations. Perhaps we could get some further clarification. It would have been better if the Department had engaged us in a constructive dialogue, rather than sending such a letter. The appeal letter objects to the report language requiring the U.S. Representative to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, to submit OECD reports to the committee prior to their release. OECD already submits these reports to its member states. The State Department, on behalf of the United States, is responsible for approving these reports before they are released. Last year, OECD released a report that dealt with a particular U.S. domestic issue which at the time was being debated in the Congress. The OECD report was not intended to coincide with the congressional action on the particular matter. However, the release of the report nevertheless unduly influenced congressional debate on the matter. Such scenarios must be prevented in the future and this is precisely what this report language seeks to address. The committee's position on this matter appears to have been substantiated by the recent release of an OECD report that made recommendations on another politically sensitive issue currently being debated by the Congress: vouchers. While in this instance the OECD recommendation was in line with my own views and position, I suspect the opponents of my position, or others who do not agree with the approach to choice and vouchers, might take issue with the OECD's timing. The report language merely states the Congress too shall have opportunities to review the list of OECD reports before they are released. State has twice failed to exercise discretion that should have led it to disapprove reports that inappropriately influenced congressional action. This report language would try to prevent that sort of failure on their part in the future. That is a fairly comprehensive response to almost every point in this letter, except the overall funding levels, which brings me back to the language of the original letter. This is the language which the Secretary of State has directed at the Senate and the Senate Appropriations Committee. He says in this letter, which I think I have responded to in a very factual and reasonably understated way, that the bill passed by the full Appropriations Committee would adversely affect U.S. foreign policy and national security interests, undermine the management of the Department, is unconstitutional, misstates the legal requirements of the reprogramming process, and raises separation of powers concerns. I think it is excessive when the Secretary of State and his Department wave the bloody shirt of national security at the Senate as a way of attacking a bill they object to for policy and funding reasons. To say that I and other members of the Appropriations Committee would adversely affect national security interests at a time like this is an attack that is highly inappropriate, certainly not diplomatic, and that is inconsistent with the facts. As I have pointed out, the letter State has sent us is inaccurate in many areas. It is a disagreement on policies which are reasonable and should have been debated in a reasonable context. So unlike the Justice Department, which sent us a very matter-of-fact and I thought appropriate, thoughtful letter outlining what their concerns were, and unlike the Commerce Department, which was pretty happy with our bill, the State Department has decided to raise this to a higher level of antipathy. I think it is a mistake, and I think the record will speak for itself when this letter is reviewed in the context of the facts as I have outlined them. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.|108302|031103|18|Scr03no03-14 1.txt|673|1460|S13751-S13784|50480|8105|NH|Judd Gregg|S|NA|Republican
10820030088072|I say to my friend, I personally do not care whether we vote or not. I think it is late. I am not sure we need a vote. I am not sure people are here to vote, but I really do not care. I simply want everyone to know, as I have said on several occasions, that someone who can be maybe not the most cooperative--but I think I am in the top 20 or so of being cooperative around here--I am happy to be cooperative in the future. But I repeat, on more than one occasion I have said today that we cannot be treated this way. We are part of the program here. We cannot tell people who live in California there is going to be a vote. They ask, well, what time is that vote going to be on Monday? Well, we don't know. What is it going to be on? We don't know, maybe something dealing with the Commerce-State- Justice. Well, what if an amendment is going to be brought up, is it not going to be debated? I don't know. I had a call from somebody who had a schedule in the eastern part of the United States today. He said: Should I come? I said: I don't know. I am going to try to protect you, but I don't know if I can. Here we are. To compound things, tomorrow is a national holiday that Senator Daschle originally agreed to work and have votes on so we could get out of here. So I don't know if there is going to be a vote. I don't know. I don't know if there is going to be a vote. I really don't know, but maybe when I finish there will be a decision made on that. Maybe tomorrow we will have a better idea of what the schedule is. I hope that in the scheduling for tomorrow we will have some definition tonight what that scheduling is going to be. Those people in the West have lost their day. They cannot go West to enter into functions sponsored by veterans on Veterans Day. They cannot do that now. They have been brought back here for various and sundry reasons, none of which they understand. If people had some idea tonight, there are still things on the East Coast that people could still do tomorrow. I am sure maybe the Senator from Illinois, if he knew what the schedule was tomorrow he could return to the Chicago area or other parts of Illinois and do things.

10820030092510|Mr. President, I commend our leader, Senator Frist, as well as Senator Grassley, Senator Baucus, and Senator Breaux, for the tremendous work in passing this very difficult bill. This is a tremendous milestone. It is great news for the seniors of our Nation. I also ask and plead with the leadership and the Members to realize that we have not yet finished work on the vitally important appropriations bills. It is extremely important we get these bills passed this year prior to the start of 2004, because there is so much in these bills that must be passed now. The Appropriations Committees, under the leadership of Chairman Stevens and Senator Byrd, have worked long and hard to produce these bills. Senator Mikulski and I fought to get an increase in veterans health of $2.9 billion. We did that because of the pressing need for our veterans. Our high-priority veterans are waiting sometimes 6 months just to get an appointment. We need that money in the VA system now, not sometime next year. We are also seeing more and more veterans coming back from the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq with serious injuries, long-term injuries, that are going to require veterans health care. We have to come to some agreement to get these bills passed this year, not sometime next year, not January or February or March. We cannot afford to miss a half a year. In addition to that, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Connecticut put in the over $1 billion needed for the Help America Vote Act.|108285|031125|1|Scr25no03-63 1.txt|16|40|S15917-S15918|1513|262|MO|Kit Bond|S|NA|Republican
10820040000062|Mr. Speaker, a constituent in my district named Virginia received something very special this Christmas. The gift, if we could call it that, came directly from the Bush White House and the Republican leadership. Pretty impressive. It arrived on December 23 and stayed through the holidays. It was a notice saying her extended unemployment benefits would end soon. Merry Christmas, Virginia. Eighty-two thousand other Washington residents face the same fate in the first 6 months of this year. It does not matter whether there is money in the account or there is a jobless recovery underway, we realize last month we got 20 jobs in the State of Washington, 1,000 in the whole country. Virginia and thousands of other average Americans will remember this Christmas for a long time as the Christmas when she was forgotten by the Republican leadership and the White House. Tonight, the President will be upbeat. I just gave my colleagues the State of the Union in one household in my district. Virginia is anything but upbeat. She is frightened, she is angry. She calls it unconscionable. We ought to call it disgraceful. I call upon the President and the Republican leadership to recognize the ordinary Americans and support them by immediately passing an extension of unemployment benefits.

10820040003768|Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Iowa for yielding me the time, and I am only going to take maybe a minute here to say that I am a cosponsor of this resolution, but I think most of the resolutions that we deal with here in this Chamber that come to this floor rightly focus on what is wrong throughout the world, whether it is the authoritarian regime of Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe or Kim Jong Il in North Korea. In this context, I think it is proper for the House to recognize positive developments, and in this case, that positive development is the vibrant democracy that is India. India adopted that Constitution on January 26 of 1950 that formalized her identity as a parliamentary democracy, and the framers of India's constitution were greatly influenced by our Founding Fathers. I had an opportunity to talk to one of those framers, and he made the point that many of the same freedoms that are enshrined in our Constitution are enshrined in theirs for a reason. So today, yes, India's the world's largest democracy and that is an impressive distinction. It is an incredible commitment when we think of 600 million people going and filing their ballots in a democratic election, but the other point I think that we are focused on tonight is the fact that it is India's growth as a world power that is creating a chance for peace and for stability in south Asia. Last month, members of the Committee on International Relations had a chance to meet with India's foreign minister to discuss the growing bilateral relationship in the areas of space and of science, and I think this resolution signals Congress' interest in furthering this important relationship. I would also be remiss if, in closing, I did not mention the growing contribution of the Indian American community here in the United States. I have always been impressed with, when working with that community, their energy, their enthusiasm and indeed their dedication to education. Their upward social mobility through education is unmatched, and I think that that particular community possesses some of our most effective future leaders in this country. So, with that said, I urge passage of this resolution, and I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.|108068|040310|12|Hcr10mr04-34 1.txt|262|296|H982-H985|2238|384|CA|Edward Royce|H|40|Republican

10820040004078|Mr. Speaker, there is no question whatsoever that the position of the administration and others in America supported the conclusion that the intelligence community, not just of the Bush administration, but of the administration that preceded it came to a singular conclusion: that Iraq was in possession of weapons of mass destruction. I am always anxious to remind my constituents in eastern Indiana that the reason we know Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction was because he used them. He used them on his own people. He used them to kill thousands in Kurdistan in the early 1990s in the immediate aftermath of the first Persian Gulf War. We are told by eyewitness accounts of men, women and children running in the middle of the night out of their bedrooms, out into the streets, grabbing their throats as they were asphyxiated by mustard gas or some other chemical agent and killed in the streets and towns of Kurdistan. Chemical weapons were used against his own people. It is not a subject of theoretical analysis or intelligence analysis; but as the gentleman from Michigan knows, it is a matter of historical fact and record that Saddam Hussein in the early 1990s possessed and used chemical weapons against his own population. What became of them in the days immediately prior to Operation Iraqi Freedom, we will continue to investigate. I traveled by the site of the Iraqi survey group in Baghdad just 1 week ago, and I know in meeting with the intelligence community there that that search goes on. And as we continue to bring Iraq forward in the family of nations, and as the people of Iraq, I believe, become more confident in their own future and in the end of the dark days of Iraq and the regime and the thugs that preceded this new Iraqi Governing Council and this new government, more people will speak and more daylight will shine, and we will eventually find out what became of this program and its horrendously dangerous by-products.|108179|040311|9|Hcr11mr04-144 1.txt|163|193|H1051-H1057|1970|339|IN|Mike Pence|H|6|Republican

10820040005532|Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2005 Budget Resolution, offered by my colleague from Virginia, Virgil Goode. His amendment was offered in the Rules Committee today, but unfortunately, the Rules Committee did not allow it to be offered on the floor of the House. Nonetheless, I want to clear my support for his amendment, had it been offered. The Goode Amendment would cut foreign aid funds by $8 billion, and use that money to pay down the deficit and take care of our veterans. From the $8 billion cut from foreign aid spending, $5 billion would be put towards the deficit and $3 billion would be put towards veterans' health care. I would have voted for this amendment, with the clarification that the $8 billion cut from foreign aid spending would not be taken from U.S. aid for Israel. Israel is our most-valued ally, and we need to do everything we can to support her. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is commensense. It takes away money from foreign aid, and gives it back to the hard-working Americans who earned the money in the first place. $5 billion would be used to put down the deficit, something we have got to start doing more. We cannot spend taxpayer dollars recklessly without thinking about our national debt, which is now up to $7.1 trillion. We owe it to our future generations to spend taxpayer money wisely so that the important programs our government provides are still around for our children and grandchildren. Also, $3 billion would be used towards veterans' health care. Mr. Chairman, since I was elected to Congress, I have done everything I possibly could for our Nation's veterans. They have done more for our country than most people will ever be asked to do, and it is important to make sure they have adequate health care. This additional $3 billion for veterans' health care funding is a step in the right direction. Again, I commend Mr. Goode for offering this worthy amendment, and I wish it could have been offered on the House floor.|108500|040324|57|Hcr24mr04-113 1.txt|1915|1945|H1451-H1466|2010|352|VA|Jo Ann Davis|H|1|Republican
10820040005768|Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this Child Nutrition Act and I ask permission to revise and extend my remarks. This bill is a step in the right direction of important reforms in federal child nutrition programs. I would like to thank Chairman Boehner, Mr. Castle and Ranking Member Mr. Miller and Ms. Woolsey for their hard work on the bill. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Chairman for taking my amendment eliminating the cost-accounting requirement for severe need breakfast programs in the manager amendment in the committee markup. This paperwork problem was brought to my attention by the director of the New Jersey Child Nutrition Programs, Kathy Kuser. Many States, including New Jersey as well as Wisconsin and Illinois, are making significant efforts to improve their school breakfast participation rate, and reducing the paperwork requirements would help these efforts. Under current law, schools in which at least 40 percent of the lunches served during the second preceding school year were free or reduced price qualify for severe need breakfast assistance. They have to calculate their costs per breakfast by prorating their labor costs, and figuring out their food, supplies and other costs associated with the school breakfast program. They have to save their receipts and calculations and submit them in order to get the severe need reimbursement. Removing the cost-accounting requirement would be a significant paperwork reduction for the schools without significantly increasing cost for the government. I also want to commend the committee for including direct certification for children from food stamp households for free school meals. Many schools are not aware of this method to determine eligibility for free meals. Direct certification improves access to eligible children for free school lunch meals and improves program integrity according to a study done by Mathematica. I am also pleased to see the bill authorizes grants for ``farm-to- cafeteria'' projects that include nutrition education activities that incorporate the participation of school children in farm and agricultural education projects and that procure local foods from small- and medium-sized farms for school meals. Finally, the expansion of eligibility for Child and Adult Care Food Program for children in shelters from age 13 to 18 who live in domestic violence shelters and homeless shelters is a wonderful improvement to the previous child nutrition legislation. My constituents who participate in Mercer Street Friends, Anchor House, Triad House, Family Preservation Center and the Family Preservation House would benefit from this change to CACFP eligibility. These organizations depend on food donations to feed their clients who are nutritionally at risk and should be eligible for this important nutrition support program. I do want to point out two provisions of the bill I wish had been improved. While there are federal dietary guidelines for meals served that are reimbursed through the Federal meals program, Federal nutrition standards for foods that are not offered through the Federal meals program are lacking. As a result, children are faced with numerous food choices during the school day with little nutritional value. Our colleague, Representative Tim Ryan offered an amendment in Committee that would have resulted in enormous improvements in the school nutrition environment for children for foods sold on campus. We also should have eliminated the reduced price school meals category. Such action would make the school meal programs more accessible to low-income families; better prepare students to learn; and make the programs easier to administer. Mr. Speaker, once again I want to thank my colleagues and their staffs for their hard work and I ask my colleague to support this bill that will eliminate barriers to participation for low-income children and families and ensure greater access to these critical nutrition programs.|108315|040324|38|Hcr24mr04-97 1.txt|2857|2920|H1395-H1413|3981|618|NJ|Rush Holt|H|12|Democratic
10820040005797|Mr. Speaker, the European Commission's antitrust investigation of Microsoft offered an opportunity to complement the recent U.S. settlement reached with the software corporation. Unfortunately, the Commission's ruling undermines the U.S. settlement and signals potential danger for the technology sector and for consumers at home and abroad. The Commission's ruling will impose drastic anticompetitive penalties on Microsoft, including a requirement that Microsoft sell a degraded version of its Windows software without a media player. Microsoft is already subject to a tough regulatory framework that promotes competition and innovation, and European consumers and companies continue to enjoy the benefits of this framework. The Commission's ruling, however, will now subject Microsoft to a new and contradictory set of regulations. The negative impact of this ruling will also extend far beyond the U.S. information technology industry as a whole. Competition authorities in other countries may now decide to follow the Commission's lead and reject long-standing principles of international comity, beginning a chain of second-guesses and doubts surrounding the U.S. in matters involving U.S. companies. For all these reasons, I strongly urge our administration to use every available resource to ensure that the European Commission reconsider its current strategy and redouble its efforts to resolve this dispute in a manner that complements rather than undermines the U.S. settlement and which offers improved computer software, not dismembered operating systems with less efficient platforms for consumers and businesses worldwide.|108515|040325|1|Hcr25mr04-13 1.txt|18|43|H1486|1637|232|WA|Brian Baird|H|3|Democratic
10820040006573|Mr. Speaker, when a woman is attacked and her child is killed, there is presently no penalty for the death of the child. Until now. Just last week, the Senate passed the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, also known as Laci and Conner's Law. It is on its way to the President's desk. Laci and Conner's Law declares that in an assault on a pregnant woman when a child is injured or killed, there are two victims. It makes the killing of an unborn child a prosecutable offense while specifically exempting abortions that are currently protected under Roe v. Wade. The overwhelming majority, 80 percent of Americans, support the idea this law represents. They believe there are two victims, and they are right. Criminals are getting away with killing children, in many cases just days before delivery. This new law will put America back on record as valuing the lives of its children. I want to again thank President Bush for his unwavering leadership on protecting and educating all of America's children.|108458|040330|1|Hcr30mr04-80 1.txt|18|33|H1650|1000|172|TX|Sam Johnson|H|3|Republican
10820040007428|Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to speak about two separate issues but both related to the economic well-being, the pocketbooks of the American people. First, the trade deficit. The Washington Post reported on February 16 that our trade deficit reached a record $489 billion in 2003. The story said that ``while the trade report showed the robust growth in U.S. consumption, it also provided a stark reminder of problems on the economy's productive side. In particular, the lack of employment growth which is attributable in part to the loss of jobs to foreign competition.'' At a hearing before the subcommittee I chair, the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, the head of the World Shipping Council said ships were coming to the U.S. full but leaving empty. We cannot sustain this type of deficit for many more years. By far the largest trade imbalance is with China and will probably be around $150 billion this year. With a tiny bit less than 4 percent of the world's population, we buy 25 percent of the world's goods. This means that every other country desperately wants into our markets. We have tremendous trade leverage that we have not used as we should have. It has been used mainly to help large multinational companies which have had great influence, too much influence, in our government. However, our trade agreements have been detrimental to the majority of American small and medium-sized businesses and to our workers. I believe other countries are probably amazed that we have not been tougher in trade negotiations. We should tell any nation with which we have a large trade imbalance, starting with China, that we want to be friends, that we want cultural and educational exchanges, tourism, and especially trade; but we want that trade to be both free and fair. We should tell the Chinese and others to start looking for products they can buy from us because if they do not start bringing down the trade deficits within a reasonable time, we will have to renegotiate some of our trade agreements. William Hawkins, Senior Fellow, at the U.S. Business and Industry Council, summed it up best in a recent column in the Washington Times: ``Commerce is driven by competition, making trade rivalry a part of the larger struggle of nations for independence, security, and prosperity.'' Mr. Speaker, I am sick and tired of seeing so many millions of American jobs going to other countries, and there is tremendous concern about this all across this Nation. Secondly, Mr. Speaker, gas prices. Gas prices have risen to some of their highest levels ever, primarily for two reasons: one, we are being robbed by foreign oil producers; and, two, extreme environmentalists oppose any oil production in the U.S. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a 19.8 million acre site, 35 times the size of the Great Smokey Mountains. Yet some left-wing extremists oppose drilling on some 2,000 acres in the Arctic Nation Wildlife Refuge, about \1/100\ of 1 percent of the refuge, in a part that is a frozen tundra with no trees or bushes for many, many miles. We have not opened a new oil refinery since 1975, and something like 36 have been forced to close since 1980 due to too many rules and regulations. If we do not, Mr. Speaker, we will become even more vulnerable to foreign nations and damage both our economy and our national security. These environmental extremists almost always come from very wealthy or upper-income families, and perhaps they do not realize how much they are hurting the poor and the lower-income and the working people of this country, but we need to produce more U.S. oil to bring down these gas prices.|108446|040401|2|Hcr01ap04pt2-21 1.txt|18|75|H2038|3643|620|TN|John 'Jimmy' Duncan|H|2|Republican

10820040008201|Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, S. 2022 designates the Federal building located at 250 West Cherry Street in Carbondale, Illinois, as the Senator Paul Simon Federal Building. This bill has the bipartisan support of the entire delegation in the State of Illinois. Although Senator Simon was born in Eugene, Oregon, he made the State of Illinois his home. Senator Simon's service to his State ranged from being a budding newspaper editor to public official to educator. After attending the University of Oregon and Dana College in Nebraska, Senator Paul Simon moved to Troy, Illinois, and pursued a career as newspaper editor and publisher. Having successfully built a chain of 14 weekly publications, Senator Paul Simon enlisted in the Army, where he served from 1951 to 1953. From 1963 until 1973, he was elected to various positions, serving in the Illinois House of Representatives, the State Senate, and also as lieutenant governor. He then continued to represent Illinois at the Federal level. He served in the House of Representatives from 1975 until 1985. Subsequently, Paul Simon ran for, and was elected to, the United States Senate, where he served until 1997. Senator Simon then returned to Illinois following his retirement and served as director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University. He passed away on December 9, 2003.

10820040019087|Mr. Chairman, I rise today in very strong support of H.R. 4548, the Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 2005. As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Human Intelligence, Analysis, and Counterintelligence, I can say unequivocally that H.R. 4548 is one of the best, most far-reaching, most constructively critical, and urgently needed authorization bills that I have been involved in. The bill makes urgently needed fixes to the CIA's human intelligence collection capability that even the DCI suggested was 5 years away from being adequate. I do not believe we can or should wait 5 years, and it also authorizes a very sizeable amount beyond the DCI's base request to ensure we keep up the maximum possible operational tempo against the counterterrorism and counterproliferation targets, both inside and outside the theater of war. In the area of analysis, significant new funds will be provided to address a critical concern: the simple lack of analytical depth. The DI analytical cadre is badly in need of bench strength and real expertise. We have been burning up our analysts in wartime conditions and shipping the majority of them to cover pressing counterterrorism requirements since the mid-1990s without being able to adequately backfill positions. Those analysts need to have the right skills, firsthand exposure to countries or issues they cover, cultural appreciation and, if at all possible, the necessary foreign language skills in order to be effective, and H.R. 4548 addresses all of these issues, particularly with regard to language, which has consistently been a high-priority item for the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and a pressing need for the whole intelligence community. The bill addresses counterintelligence shortfalls, ensures that the necessary infrastructure for field operations, training, and a host of other important activities are adequately funded, and brings astonishingly new technical tools into play. The bill continues the committee's long-standing efforts to get the CIA's dangerously flawed compensation reform plan back on track; and it demonstrates that we strongly support a more aggressive, risk-taking, innovative intelligence collection posture. Such a posture would finally give us a fighting chance to penetrate terrorist groups. It would also allow us to tackle other hard-target countries, countries that have plans and intentions to do us harm. Overall, H.R. 4548 demonstrates that we are going to back up our spies and our analysts when it counts the most. To my distinguished colleagues on both sides of the aisle, this war we are in is not just about Iraq or about Afghanistan or about where Osama bin Laden may be hiding. It is truly a global war on terrorism with significant global challenges; and these include money laundering, illicit traffic, the preaching of hate, kidnapping, extortion, and even at the national level, as we saw, the Madrid train bombing and the elections that followed. It is a war that is going to take time to win. It is a war that is going to take fortitude to win, and it is a war that is going to take a substantial and continued investment in our intelligence community. I ask my distinguished colleagues to support H.R. 4548 for the sake of our Nation's security. Some of my colleagues across the aisle have decided that it is not important to provide for the intelligence community in the middle of the global war on terrorism, and I say it could not be more important. This bill moves us closer to acquiring the capabilities and directions that are needed not only to win the war on terror but to win the peace in Iraq and to make sure we do not forget about the rest of the world. We must never forget that the actions of others affects U.S. national security interests. We must never retreat in the face of evil. Vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4548 because it is urgently needed. The Nation simply cannot afford to shortchange its men and women out on the frontlines.|108296|040623|13|Hcr23jn04-70 1.txt|349|411|H4824-H4855|3974|653|NV|Jim Gibbons|H|2|Republican

Now that is just what this country needs, a trial lawyer in the second most powerful position in the United States. That is just what America needs, a well-positioned trial lawyer who can make certain we sue more health care providers, sue more hospitals and drug companies. That is just what America needs, a trial lawyer who can ensure we sue more manufacturers and corporations. If trial lawyers have not driven our health care costs out of sight and our job overseas, we need to give them a better platform to finish the job. Let us be frank, Madam Speaker, America needs a trial lawyer at the helm like Custer needed another Indian at Big Horn. However, there might be a bright side to having more trial lawyers in Washington, since the courts have given terrorists the right to have their own lawyers.

10820040026063|Mr. Speaker, I want to commend all of those who have shown leadership on this issue. I have been told that the only way that evil can triumph is that good people do nothing. I believe it was Dante who suggested that the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who declare neutrality and do nothing in times of great moral crisis. We have all heard the atrocities that are continuously being heaped upon the people in the Sudan. It is time for us to act, and to act convincingly. We have to ask ourselves the question, if not us, then who? If not now, then when? I commend the gentleman from New Jersey and all of those who have demonstrated great leadership on this issue. We are here tonight to sound the alarm, once again, on genocide in Sudan. There is no room for neutrality in the face of the crimes being committed there each day. Amnesty International has renewed its charge that the international community is not doing enough to protect women in the Darfur region and the refugee camps in Chad where mass rape is being used as a weapon. Since 1983, more than two million Black civilians have died during the Civil War in the south of Sudan. That struggle was especially brutal for the civilian population: slave raids resulting in the enslavement of women and children, gang rape, ethnic cleansing, and the imposition of famine conditions for hundreds of thousands. On October 21, 2002, the President signed the Sudan Peace Act which stated, in part: ``The acts of the Government of Sudan constitute genocide as defined by the [United Nations] Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide .'' That bill requires President Bush to certify, every six months, that the government in Khartoum is negotiating in good faith for an end to that Civil War. According to some sources, we may be close to a framework for peace in that region. On May 12th The New York Times carried this report: ``A team of U.S. diplomats led by Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Charles Snyder is on its way to Kenya to help put the final touches on an agreement to end Sudan's 21-year civil war, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Wednesday.'' However, at the same time, Khartoum has launched a massive ethnic cleansing of Black Africans in Darfur, in the western region of Sudan. The same article in the New York Times reported: ``He said Snyder also would discuss with Sudanese officials the situation in the western Darfur region where human rights groups charge the Khartoum government and allied Arab militia are carrying out a campaign of `ethnic cleansing' against Black African tribes, forcing some 1 million people to flee their homes.'' Human Rights Watch and investigators for the United Nations have documented widespread ethnic cleansing and have characterized the situation there as ``crimes against humanity.'' More than 100,000 have fled the region and are now refugees in neighboring Chad. As the seasonal rains begin to set in, it is becoming more and more difficult to move refugees to relative safety and to provide even minimal subsistence. Malnutrition is at acute levels in the camps especially among children. So, while our diplomats expressed their ``grave concern'' to the UN Human Rights Commission response to the murder, rape and forced removals in western Sudan, the President gave his certification that Khartoum was negotiating in ``good faith'' to end the decades old struggle in the south. If the President had chosen to withhold that certification, it would have instituted a program of significant economic sanction against Sudan. How, one might ask, can the government of Sudan negotiate in ``good faith'' to end genocide in one region, and openly engage in genocide in another region? And how, it is reasonable to ask, can our own government accept the notion of negotiating in ``good faith'' in one region of the Sudan, while conducting a ruthless genocide in another? Mr. Speaker, only a short time ago we paused here to mark the tenth anniversary of the genocide in Rwanda. More than 800,000 died while the world watched, and did nothing. Once again genocide is unfolding before us. Those who have taken note have expressed their horror at what they have seen. But where is the public outcry? Where are the front page pictures? Where is the response of our government on behalf of the American people? The ominous sign is that our government is willing to turn its eyes away from genocide in the West of the Sudan in favor of resuming oil production in the oil rich Southern region. The genocide in the South was characterized by both racial and religious differences. The genocide in the Western region pits Muslim against Muslim but retains the racial character of the genocide in the South. Mr. Speaker. In the name of fighting terrorism we have begun a campaign under the rubric of the Global Peace Operations. Even though President Bush has not formally announced the initiative, U.S. troops are now active from Djibouti on the Gulf of Aden to the Atlantic including Mali, Mauritania, Chad and Niger. The question we now confront is this: is the slaughter of hundreds of thousands, even millions of Africans, terrorism? If our struggle against terrorism is truly global, can we be truly engaged in a global war on terrorism, and not engage genocide in Africa? Mr. Speaker, funding for State Department programs in Africa such as the African Contingency Operations Training and Assistance program and the Enhanced International Peacekeeping Capacities have languished for years. If we are to engage in a new anti-terrorism initiative in Africa, I would hope the President would consult with the Congress and with the Congressional Black Caucus as to how the struggle against terrorism will be shaped so as to protect the people of Africa as well as the peoples of the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia. Mr. Speaker, on June 24 the U.S. Holocaust Museum here in Washington took the dramatic step of closing access to its main exhibitions to call attention to the horror underway in Darfur. Around that same time U.N. Secretary General Koffi Annan and U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell paid a visit to the western Sudan. Secretary Powell expressed his deep concern over what he saw with his own eyes as an humanitarian crisis. But he failed to place the events in the Sudan in their proper historical context: the world is once again facing the onslaught of genocide. When asked, Secretary Powell, speaking on behalf of this administration, was asked if this was genocide responded, ``Let's not put a label on things.'' Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that is exactly what we need to do. Our failure to acknowledge genocide in the Sudan led directly to the abdication of the G-8 leaders in their responsibilities to intervene to save the lives of tens of thousands of African men, women and children as called for by the International Genocide Convention. Mr. Speaker, if America cannot remember the great lessons of history, cannot confront genocide, or if we do not count the deaths of tens of thousands of Africans as genocide then the days ahead are sure to be some of the saddest and most difficult we have ever confronted.|108159|040721|32|Hcr21jy04-143 1.txt|865|985|H6525-H6536|7206|1223|IL|Danny Davis|H|7|Democratic

One example would be just a little over a week ago I used the phrase ``cultural continuity'' on the floor of this Congress. Within hours, there was a press release out declaring I was a racist. Now cultural continuity does not define anything other than this great unity of America, but the Members on the other side leaped to that conclusion, and I would ask the body would people who simultaneously pass public judgment be the same kind of people who would decide a case of hate crimes as jurors.

10820040034470|Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Menendez substitute amendment. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Menendez Substitute, and in particular, its creation of a Privacy and Civil Liberties Board within the Executive branch as unanimously recommended by the 9/11 Commission. After months and months of study, and months and months of hearing testimony and reviewing volumes of documents, the 9/11 Commission unanimously recommended that there be a board ``within the government whose job it is to look across the government at the actions we are taking to protect ourselves to ensure that liberty concerns are appropriately considered.'' Because I take the protection of our constitutional rights and liberties very seriously, I offered an amendment during the Judiciary Committee markup of this bill to establish an independent, bipartisan board to oversee compliance with civil liberties and the Judiciary Committee bill included a version of the oversight board. The Menendez substitute establishes such a board. Now there are those who might suggest that an advisory board created by the President by executive order satisfies the mandate of the 9/11 Commission. It does not. That board consists of Administration insiders with advisory functions. In the words of the Vice Chairman of the 9/11 Commission, we must establish a board that is ``robust,'' one that has the authority to secure our freedoms against abuse. We all agree that our Nation must adjust to confront the terrorist threat, but in doing so we cannot undermine the principles for which Americans stand. One need not look far to imagine the types of abuses that a Privacy and Civil Liberties Board could expose and prevent. Should innocent Americans be held merely on suspicion, without the opportunity to consult with counsel and without the ability to speak with their family? After two years of detention without access to family or counsel, a U.S. citizen was recently released from Guantanamo because he was no longer of ``intelligence value.'' Should Americans be willing to miss graduations, baptisms, weddings, and funerals, because their names are erroneously on a no-fly list? If Senator Kennedy, Congressman John Lewis and Congressman Young find themselves detained as suspected terrorists, who will be next? Just last week, a federal district court ruled that the FBI's use of ``national security letters'' to compel the production of customer records from internet service providers was unconstitutional. In short, just as we need to make adjustments as we fight terrorism, we also need this independent board to make sure that fighting terrorism is done in a manner that does not change the fundamental nature of our society. In closing, let me quote directly from the 9/11 Commission's findings in connection with its recommendation that there be a board to protect civil liberties: The substitute implements the recommendation of the 9/11 Commission and should be supported. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''|108367|041007|82|Hcr07oc04pt2-118 1.txt|2687|2742|H8828-H8851|3003|476|NC|Melvin Watt|H|12|Democratic

10820040038188|I don't deny that this legislation is better than it has been. I make two points: One, it is not enough to keep pace with the annual demands on the system, both for maintenance and to avoid increasing congestion. Every survey I have seen, including those I just cited, give statistical validation to that. The second concern is that we are going to be adding to one of the other deficits in this country, which is our fiscal deficit, by diverting money which otherwise would have gone into general revenue in order to pay the cost of both the highway and the public transit system. Finally, the specific elements of that transfer from general revenue to the transportation fund are extremely questionable. I mentioned one set of so-called tax loophole closers that we have already spent before. How much confidence can we have that this bill is going to get to the finish line before the jobs bill or the charitable giving bill, so that this essential part of the financing package is still available? I think it is a high risk. I say that to someone who knows something about high risk.

10820040046925|Mr. President, I would like to recognize a great American and a true military hero who has honorably served our country for 32 years in the Army and Army Nurse Corps: Colonel Deborah A. Gustke. Colonel Gustke has a true passion for nursing and served in a variety of clinical nursing and leadership positions at various Army medical facilities including Fort Benning, GA, Tripler Army Medical Center, Hawaii, and Fort Hood, TX. Her tremendous leadership skills led to her selection as a nurse recruiter and subsequent selection for long-term civilian schooling to obtain an advanced degree as an oncology clinical nurse specialist. Colonel Gustke served with distinction in a series of senior leadership positions as chief nurse at Fort Knox, KY, Fort Rucker, AL, and at Fort Bliss, TX, and as the Army Nurse Corps personnel proponent staff officer. In every circumstance, Colonel Gustke was recognized for her clinical excellence and stellar leadership. In 2000, Colonel Gustke was appointed the Assistant Chief of the Army Nurse Corps. As assistant chief, Colonel Gustke developed and implemented policies and procedures that affected nearly 35,000 nursing personnel throughout the Army. Collaborating with senior Army and Department of Defense organizations, she worked to successfully obtain direct hire authority, thereby dramatically reducing the hiring time for civilian nurses. She spearheaded several recruitment and retention initiatives, including the $18 million Health Professional Loan Repayment Program, the critical skills retention bonus, and increased capacity for the Army Enlisted Commissioning Program. Her efforts decreased the impact of the national nursing shortage on the Army. In addition, she implemented the recognition of the advanced practice nurse role for the Army Medical Department. As chair of the Federal Nursing Service Council, she sponsored the development of a Federal nursing research model that focused on improving soldier readiness and patient-care outcomes. Colonel Gustke's accomplishments are eloquent testimony to her talent, dedication, loyalty, and determination in ensuring that the best possible nursing care is always available to our soldiers, their family members and our deserving retirees. Colonel Gustke has established a legacy of superior performance to be emulated by all, which reflects greatly on herself, the United States Army, the Department of Defense, and the United States of America. I extend my deepest appreciation on behalf of a grateful Nation for her dedicated service. Congratulations to Colonel Gustke. I wish her Godspeed.|108148|040401|1|Scr01ap04-86 1.txt|16|55|S3564|2600|390|HI|Daniel Inouye|S|NA|Democratic
10820040047602|Yes. I share my colleague's understanding. Under current law, the IRS is authorized to waive all or a portion of the minimum funding standard requirements for a given year or, alternatively, to allow plans to extend the period for amortizing their liabilities for up to an additional 10 years, so long as certain required showings are made. IRS regulations also include what is known as the ``shortfall funding method.'' The enactment of the short-term multiemployer plan relief in this legislation is not in any way intended to foreclose the availability of any of these existing relief measures to multiemployer plans.|108190|040408|54|Scr08ap04-26 1.txt|1692|1701|S3968-S3996|620|100|IA|Charles Grassley|S|NA|Republican

10820040052470|Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fairness in Immigration Litigation Act. The purpose of the Fairness in Immigration Litigation Act is to reform the statutory scheme governing judicial review of immigration removal orders. Currently, we have an absurd situation in which criminal aliens are entitled to more review and have more opportunities to file frivolous dilatory appeals than non-criminal aliens. The legislation which I am introducing will streamline the process of reviewing final administrative immigration orders, thereby eliminating such unfair results under the current statutory scheme. In 1961, Congress amended Section 106 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, or INA, to specify the circumstances under which final orders of deportation and exclusion could be reviewed in the federal courts. The statute provided that petitions for review in the circuit courts of appeal were the ``sole and exclusive'' procedure for reviewing deportation orders, and that habeas corpus was available only to challenge exclusion orders of the custodial aspects of immigration detention. The jurisprudence was settled that there were no alternative or additional avenues of judicial review of immigration orders beyond those provided in Section 106. In 1996, seeking to provide for the more efficient and expeditious removal of aliens who commit serious crimes in the United States, Congress attempted to streamline the judicial review of immigration orders against such aliens. Passed by wide, bipartisan margins, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act eliminated judicial review of immigration orders for most criminals. IIRIRA recognized that criminal aliens had already received a full measure of due process in their criminal cases, as well as in their immigration proceedings, and that additional review typically only served to delay their inevitable removal. However, because the 1996 reforms lacked express language precluding habeas corpus review, the Supreme Court decided in INS v. St. Cyr that habeas review remained available to criminal aliens other than or in addition to the review specified in the INA. Consequently, under current law, criminal aliens may seek habeas review of their deportation orders in district courts and then appeal adverse decisions to the courts of appeals. By contrast, non-criminal aliens are governed by INA Sec. 242, and must appeal directly to the court of appeals without the additional layer of review in the district courts. The result is that criminal aliens who have no claim to relief from deportation file frivolous petitions, causing serious delay in securing final judgment against them. This is a complete perversion of the reforms intended by Congress in 1996, and it must be corrected. Let me illustrate the extent of the problem. In 1995, just before IIRIRA's enactment, there were 403 immigration habeas petitions filed. In 2003, that number rose to 2,374. Over the same period, the total number of immigration-related cases in federal courts rose from 1,939 to 11,906. This is after Congress passed a law to limit the review for criminal aliens. Clearly, the intent of Congress has been frustrated. Consistent with the settled principled that petitions for review should be the ``sole and exclusive'' means of judicial review for aliens challenging their removal  , the Fairness in Immigration Litigation Act streamlines immigration review and protects an alien's right to review by an independent judiciary. It also ensures that even criminal aliens may receive review of pure questions of law and Constitutional claims, as dictated by the Supreme Court in S. Cyr. With the expanded subject matter jurisdiction in the courts of appeals, the proposed legislation will eliminate the confusing, and indeed inequitable practice of allowing criminal aliens to obtain an additional layer of review through habeas corpus petitions. This legislation is fully consistent with both the Supreme Court's decision in S. Cyr and settled jurisprudence regarding the availability of habeas corpus. These reforms will ensure that aliens will have their day in court, and ensures that the law does not place criminals in a position that is superior to non-criminals. In sum, the Act restores order to the judicial review process in the courts as well as fairness for alien petitioners. Moreover, the deportation proceedings too often are frustrated by activist judges who place unreasonable burdens on the government to show why a lawfully issued deportation order should be enforced, and who stop the lawful execution of deportation orders even though the aliens have advanced no legal basis to challenge the deportation order. Such activism combined with murkiness in the law have slowed and in some cases halted the government's ability to deport criminal aliens and others who have no right to stay. It is time we clarify the law so that the government can effectively deport those who should be deported. Often, we hear complaints that the government is not doing enough to protect our borders against illegal entry, and that we need to do more to catch and deport the illegal aliens who have made their way into our country. Without question, sealing our borders and arresting every illegal alien is a monumental undertaking. But with this legislation, we can easily address the immediate problem of removing the illegal aliens that we already have in the system, and sometimes even in our custody. I want to emphasize that the Fairness in Immigration Litigation Act does not abridge an immigration detainee's right to challenge actual, physical custody through a habeas corpus petition. It is not my intention at all to take away the habeas petition as a legitimate way to challenge physical custody. Instead, this legislation narrowly applies to judicial review of final agency orders of removal, which involve legal issues that should be reviewed through a petition for review by the court of appeals. I further want to emphasize that nothing in this legislation deprives deportable aliens of all the procedural and substantive due process that the Supreme Court said was required. It simply bars unnecessary delays through collateral attacks. In fact, the only ones who are affected by this bill are criminals who have had their review, but who want to avoid enforcement of their deportation orders by initiating dilatory, collateral attacks, and perhaps their lawyers who charge thousands of dollars to file petitions that they know to be without merit. In sum, the legislation which I am introducing today will expand the subject matter jurisdiction of the court of appeals so that criminal aliens will receive the judicial review to which they are entitled according to St. Cyr. At the same time, the legislation will streamline the process so that we no longer have the absurd result of criminals getting more protection than non-criminals. The legislation also will reduce the possibility that criminals who are without any statutory relief from deportation can abuse the system by filing frivolous petitions solely to delay their eventual removal from the United States. Furthermore, the legislation will properly place the burden of showing eligibility for relief from deportation upon the applicants for relief, and will clarify our statute so that the government can more effectively execute deportation orders without encountering the obstacles that ambiguous statutes have created. I ask for the support of my colleagues in passing the Fairness in Immigration Litigation Act, which will restore procedural fairness for all immigrants, but will significantly reduce the backlog in our judicial system created by frivolous and dilatory appeals.

10820040059780|Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the United States-Australia Free Trade Agreement, FTA, which is currently pending before this body. This agreement is the culmination of nearly two years of difficult negotiations and hard work by U.S. and Australian officials. Today we have the opportunity to pass the implementing legislation that would pave the way for formal adoption of this FTA, and when that vote occurs, I intend to support this agreement. As my colleagues are aware, U.S. exports to Australia totaled over $13 billion in 2003. According to the United States Trade Representative, USTR, Australia is quickly growing as a major destination for U.S. goods. For example, over the past 5 years, the rate of growth for U.S. exports to that nation has increased more than twofold over U.S. exports to the rest of the world. And during these years, aerospace products and parts--a sector vital to U.S. manufacturing and our national security--have been the leading growth category. In 2003, the aerospace sector exported an impressive $2.4 billion in merchandise to Australia. Since 1999, my home State of Connecticut has witnessed a 72.8 percent increase in the value of its exports to Australia. Trade with that nation directly supports more than 1,800 jobs in Connecticut. Other States have benefited similarly. Indeed, during this same time period, U.S. exports as measured by dollar increases have grown faster in only seven other nations. But these figures and the potential impact of this agreement are even more striking when one examines the types of items that we export to Australia. I point out to my colleagues that a full 92 percent of U.S. exports to that nation are manufactured goods. I know that I don't need to remind my colleagues that over the past several years, more than two million manufacturing jobs have been lost here in the U.S. More than 30,000 people in my home State of Connecticut have lost jobs in the manufacturing sector. In a variety of ways, we here in Congress have sought to address the domestic loss of manufacturing jobs and infrastructure. I have worked hard to affect a turnaround in the conditions of this sector--long the lynchpin of the U.S. economy. It doesn't take an economist to realize that this agreement will likely help to strengthen U.S. manufacturing. That is not to say that a United States-Australia FTA will be a panacea for our manufacturing woes here at home. It will not. But in my view, the steady growth and large manufacturing component of United States-Australia bilateral trade suggest that it will help. For this Senator, that fact is one of the most compelling reasons to support a United States-Australia FTA. Moreover, it should not go without mention that in 2001, 86 percent of U.S. exports to Australia were from small and medium-sized businesses. That figure--86 percent--amounted to more than 16,000 U.S. firms. If this trend continues, with the passage of this agreement, tens of thousands of small and medium-sized businesses here in the U.S. also stand to benefit. Nearly 2 years ago, I voted against final passage of fast track authority for the President. I did so because I didn't believe that legislation included adequate language making it crystal clear that a primary negotiating objective of future trade agreements must be to ensure that our trading partners live up to internationally accepted labor and environmental standards. In that context, I believe that Australia is a model of what we should expect from other governments with whom we craft trade agreements. Australia is more than just a staunch ally--it is also a nation that has substantial labor and environmental protections. These protections will help to safeguard the lives of workers globally and the natural resources on which we all depend. Equally as important, they will help to ensure that American workers are given a level playing field on which to compete. Despite my overall support for this agreement, I feel that it is important to mention one item of concern. As my colleagues are aware, the United States-Australia FTA includes language that would allow prescription drug manufacturers to prevent the reimportation of their products. We do not currently import drugs from Australia, and that is unlikely to change given that Australian law prohibits the exportation of prescription drugs. So as a practical matter, this provision of the FTA will not affect drug prices in this country. But I want to make it perfectly clear that this should not set a precedent, nor prevent us from adopting a law that would allow drug reimportation in the future. While I will live with this provision in the context of a bilateral agreement with Australia, I do not believe that it should have broader global implications. This concern aside, I look forward to voting on the implementing legislation for the United States-Australia FTA. I intend to cast my vote in favor of this agreement, and I encourage my colleagues to do the same.|108098|040715|84|Scr15jy04-147 1.txt|4883|4963|S8178-S8217|5001|826|CT|Christopher Dodd|S|NA|Democratic

To make the picture clear, that is like a bank holding a mortgage on your home. They hold the paper on America. They can call due those notes at any time, I presume, or within a reasonable time, and could insist upon us paying back those obligations. So, in other words, our economic well-being is in no small measure tied to the desires of nations that may not have the same goals as we do, either in economic or foreign policy. They hold the mortgage, in a sense, on our future; is that correct?|108098|040922|6|Scr22se04-197 1.txt|319|329|S9483-S9486|699|129|CT|Christopher Dodd|S|NA|Democratic
10820040065556|Before the Senator from Virginia leaves, I think we have the same goal in this amendment.

That way it would be clear that in this provision we are not affecting the other authorities of these departments, but neither are we wiping out what this legislation has done.|108219|041001|270|Scr01oc04-78 1.txt|7126|7135|S10197-S10252|608|107|ME|Susan Collins|S|NA|Republican
10820040068027|Mr. President, I would just like to emphasize again that the current situation is one that is working. Unless one can show that it is not working in terms of the authority or the jurisdiction of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I would argue, why change it. Secondly, this amendment would then subject the appointees of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Deputy Director, and other people to jurisdictions in two committees, which would make the appointment process longer than it is today in an area that is particularly important to the President. What he wants to do immediately is to get his director of budget on board. Secondly, I think we need to point out that the budget process is not just the jurisdiction of the Budget Committee. Under this amendment, if I want to put a bill in, for example, to reform the budget process to 2-year budgets, to require that the budget include a presentation on the accrued liabilities of the United States and, for that matter, go back and look at the Budget Act of 1974, which should be updated, that bill would have to go to the Budget Committee. If the members of that committee were unhappy with that, if they like the process of 1-year budgets because of the fact that they like to take a bite out of the apple each year, that bill would be dead. Under the current situation, if someone has an idea of improving the budget process that impacts not only the budget but the entire operation of Government, they can bring it to the Governmental Affairs Committee. We could handle that legislation, and then that legislation would have to be referred to the Budget Committee for their consideration. The fact is, this is too large a responsibility just to put it within the jurisdiction of the Budget Committee. I argue that it makes a lot of sense to leave the situation as it is unless somebody can tell me that it is not working. I will say one other thing: Our Government's biggest problem today is management. Having jurisdiction of the Office of Management and Budget in Governmental Affairs has given this Senator a lot of leverage to get this administration to do some things that are important for the country.

10820040070374|Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the Omnibus appropriations bill. I think the American people would be appalled by the process under which the Senate is considering this bill. Provisions have been added that have never been debated, never had a hearing, and never had a vote in the Senate. It is thousands of pages long, and yet the Senate has had only a few hours to read the bill. We are just beginning to learn about all of the provisions that have been added. Already, we have learned about an outrageous provision that would allow for a complete reversal of longstanding privacy protections. The bill contains a provision that allows Appropriations Committee chairman, or their designees, to review the tax returns of any American citizen. Any individual, any corporation could have their very private information poured over by any number of people. Not only would the private, sensitive tax information be available to the Chairmen and their staffs--they would be able to distribute that information without incurring any penalties. This egregious ``oversight'' is inexcusable. That a provision with this impact, on both privacy rules and on powers of the Senate, would be slipped in at the midnight hour with no oversight, is an offense to every Member of the Senate and most importantly, to the American people. While I am relieved that promises have been made to remove this egregious provision, this is just an example of the danger that comes with rushing a bill like this through the Senate. This is simply indefensible. The American people deserve a more serious effort, and I cannot support a bill that has been rushed through in this manner. I am also troubled by much of what we already know about this bill. This bill demonstrates that the budget deficit our Nation is facing today is causing real cuts in important programs and real pain for working families. These tight budget numbers are the consequence of a fiscal policy that puts reckless and expensive tax cuts for the wealthiest in our country above all other priorities. That policy has left us with huge deficits and the inability to fully fund some of our Nation's most pressing needs--needs like education, health care, law enforcement and housing. Clearly, we need to take another look at our Nation's fiscal policy and finally put together a budget plan that meet the needs of American families. The Omnibus appropriations bill before us simply falls short on too many of our priorities. I recognize that it includes a $500 million increase for the title I education program for disadvantaged students and a $607 million increase for special education. I am grateful that increases were provided during these difficult times but let's not forget that even with these increases, funding for No Child Left Behind is still far below the levels authorized when the law passed. We are still not coming anywhere close to our commitment to fund 40 percent of the costs of special education. And once again, the maximum Pell Grant award has been frozen leaving more students with higher student loan debts or shut out of higher education altogether. These are just a few examples. I believe we should be able to do better when it comes to our Nation's students and schools. In addition, I am very disappointed with the practical elimination of the COPS Universal Hiring program. The Omnibus appropriations bill allocates a paltry $10 million for this nationwide program--a program that has added tens of thousands of police officers to police departments across the country. Not surprisingly, the COPS program has been overwhelmingly popular among our local police departments in Wisconsin and beyond. Moreover, crime has been steadily decreasing in the past decade thanks in part to the COPS program. A mere $10 million is not enough for a program that received more than $300 million just a few years ago. Quite simply, this appropriations bill demonstrates an insensitivity to the needs of our police officers who are also the first line of defense in the war on terror. This Omnibus bill also contains inadequate support for energy saving research. One of the programs that I was disappointed did not receive sufficient funding in this bill was the Department of Energy's Industrial Technologies program. This program is an important effort to invest in our manufacturing base by increasing energy efficiency. This program invests in research to improve industrial energy efficiency and environmental performance in eight basic, energy intensive industries named by DoE as Industries of the Future: aluminum, chemicals, forest products, glass, metal casting, mining, petroleum and steel. An example of such a program in Wisconsin that is applicable to all eight DOE Industries of the Future in Wisconsin is the project ``Wireless Sensor Network for Advanced Energy Management Solutions'' which applies advanced communications and sensors technology to industrial motors. The projected benefits from this program in 2020 include energy savings of 279 trillion Btus, $1.3 billion and 116 million pounds of pollutant reduction. It is my hope that DOE reconsider this very important technology development and that the Interior Appropriations subcommittee focus next year on this program because of the impact it will have on our manufacturing capabilities in the United States. I am also very concerned about the across-the-board cut that is included in this bill. The bill includes a cut of 0.83 percent that will apply to every program. That means the increases some programs received will be scaled back, and those programs that received flat funding will actually get a cut from last year's levels after the across-the-board reduction goes into effect. I am particularly disappointed that this bill fails to address one critical area that is very important to me regarding dairy. As I have stated many times before on the floor of the Senate, dairy is an extremely important part of the economy of the Upper Midwest. For Wisconsin alone, employment associated with dairy farming, processing and related activities is estimated to be about 160,000, generating roughly $5 billion in income annually. During the 2002 farm bill, a new dairy program was created, called the Milk Income Loss Contract, MILC, program, to provide countercyclical assistance to all dairy farmers in the nation, whenever market prices for milk fall below certain trigger levels. The program provides assistance in the form of direct payments to producers, up to the first 2.4 million pounds of production annually, when market prices are low. While the MILC program uses the market as a reference price to trigger assistance, it does not directly intervene into the market. In 2002 and the first half of 2003, dairy prices reached 25-year lows. During that time, the MILC program provided dairy producers with much needed assistance. Wisconsin dairy producers have received $413 million in assistance under the program to date. Without a doubt, dairy producers prefer to receive their income from the marketplace. Fortunately, milk prices have recovered over the last year, and as a result, the MILC program is now dormant. However, the safety net provided by the MILC program has been extremely helpful, particularly during times of low market prices. Unfortunately, the MILC program is scheduled to expire in September of 2005, 2 years earlier than the rest of the farm bill commodity programs. Recognizing this problem, a bipartisan, multiregional coalition of Senators sought to remedy the situation during this year's appropriations process by extending the MILC program for 2 more years. Such an extension would put the MILC program on equal footing with other farm bill commodity programs. On October 7, the President of the United States personally entered the debate on MILC extension. He traveled to Wisconsin to voice his support for the MILC program and before a group of Wisconsin dairy families stated: Our effort to extend the MILC program was also endorsed by a bipartisan, multiregional group of Governors. I ask unanimous consent that the Governors' letter of support be printed in the Record. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:|108538|041120|7|Scr20no04-297 1.txt|1726|1917|S11751-S11767|8261|1341|WI|Herb Kohl|S|NA|Democratic

10920050002544|Mr. Chairman, I would like to clarify the scope of preemption under H.R. 4167, because some confusing and misleading things have been said on this subject. While I have great respect for the Association of Food and Drug Officials, especially for the work its members do at the state level, I would specifically like to clarify some mistaken points the group made in a letter dated January 16th of this year. This letter stated that H.R. 4167 would preempt state laws on food sanitation, including milk sanitation statutes on the books in Minnesota and most other states. This is not the case. The bill we're considering today would not preempt state food sanitation standards. H.R. 4167 only provides for federal preemption of certain requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, and these are specified in the legislation. If a requirement of the FFDCA is not specified in H.R. 4167, then it will not be preempted by H.R. 4167, and states can establish or maintain requirements that are different from federal ones. This is the case when it comes to sanitation. Again, Mr. Chairman, states would still be free to enact state sanitation standards that are not identical to federal sanitation standards. Even if H.R. 4167 did preempt state laws on food sanitation, which it again does not, it would still not preempt state milk sanitation laws. Through this bill, for preemption to be found in general, there must be a conflict between a state law and a federal requirement of the FFDCA or certain other federal laws and regulations. But in the case of milk sanitation, there is no federal law or regulation for a state law to conflict with. There are only the FDA definitions of ``pasteurized'' and ``ultra-pasteurized'' milk, which are agreed upon by agencies at all levels of government and the entire dairy industry, and the general manufacturing practice regulations applicable to all foods. Along these lines, Mr. Chairman, I ask that the dairy industry's letter of support for H.R. 4167 be included in the Record following my remarks. These were conscious decisions made by the authors of H.R. 4167, decisions that, I think it is safe to say, are certainly agreed upon by the over 225 cosponsors of this bill, including myself. We recognize that states have often been at the forefront of regulating food sanitation, and for this reason, one of our legislative intents through this bill was that food sanitation standards should not and would not be preempted. H.R. 4167 recognizes that it makes no sense to have a ``patchwork quilt'' of different states adopting different regulatory requirements on identical food product labeling. National uniformity in food laws is actually the norm, not the exception. All meat and poultry regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture have national uniformity under the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act. The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 established uniform nutrition labeling requirements on manufactured foods. In addition, the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 included a uniformity provision for pesticide tolerance standards in food products. H.R. 4167 completes the job by establishing national uniformity for food additives and warning labels. H.R. 4167 enjoys the support of 227 bipartisan co-sponsors and was reported by a bipartisan vote from the Energy and Commerce Committee on December 15,2005. America's dairy industry believes consumers deserve a single standard when it comes to food safety, and this bill will allow states and the Food and Drug Administration to work collaboratively in establishing sound food safety labeling policies that benefit, not confuse consumers. We urge your vote for H.R. 4167.|109142|050216|3|Hcr16fe05-75 75.txt|42|86|H643-H652|2821|482|GA|Phil Gingrey|H|11|Republican

10920050005129|Mr. Speaker, I am very honored today to introduce to you the gentleman who just gave our opening prayer, our guest pastor, John Wright Coker, Jr., from Fayetteville, North Carolina. Jay, as he is known to all of us as his friends, is a native of Leland, North Carolina, in southeastern North Carolina, which I have the great opportunity to represent. His commitment to spreading the word of God both here in the United States and abroad is unparalleled. Currently serving in his 12th year as pastor of First Presbyterian Church of Fayetteville, Jay has also led churches in South Carolina, Tennessee, and Mississippi. Active in the Presbyterian Church U.S.A., Dr. Coker serves on the Presbytery Council, the Committee on Budget and Finance, and the Outreach Foundation. In addition, he has traveled the world with passion and purpose to spread God's word. From Mexico to the Middle East to Cuba, he has worked to build brighter and stronger communities while opening hearts and minds to the power and promise of God's unconditional love. Mr. Speaker, Jay is blessed with a strong family, who are here with him today, including his wife, Sharon, and children John, Joseph, and Margaret Ann, and other friends and his mother. Our State of North Carolina and Nation are blessed to have him as an ambassador of the Holy Scriptures and an ambassador of the promise we have for tomorrow.

From Karabilah to Ramadi, Iraqi troops and coalition forces have captured terrorists during raids and discovered weapons including hand grenades, rocket propelled grenade launch motors, sticks of plastic explosives, and AK-47 rifles. The Victory in Iraq Caucus is grateful to recognize their successes to protect American families in the central front of the global war on terrorism. With every terrorist they detain and each weapon they discover, Iraqi troops and American forces save lives and improve our security.

10920050013333|Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this bill, and I applaud the leadership and the hard work of Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member Sabo in bringing this bill to the floor. I would like to begin by saying that the budget resolution has created inadequacies in this bill from the start. Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member Sabo have done a fine job of distributing the scarce funding that is available. They have been able to accomplish this difficult task despite the OMB's use of a proposed new aviation security fee, which was a budgetary gimmick that the Administration knew this Congress would not support and probably did not even support itself. This fee was yet another attempt by the Administration to fool the American people into thinking that we can pass out money to the wealthy while sinking hundreds of billions into the quagmire in Iraq, and that none of it will hurt. But again, I want to emphasize that Chairman Rogers and Mr. Sabo are not at fault here. In fact, I congratulate them for being able to restore much of the funding in this bill for our states and localities, which have always been on the front lines of our battles against terrorism. Mr. Speaker, I understand we have a problem in this government with short attention spans, but it is outrageous to me that not even half a decade after Sept. 11, the Administration proposed to cut state and local assistance by over 20 percent. It completely eliminated the SAFER program, which helps our struggling local fire departments fulfill ever increasing homeland security missions. Just because we haven't needed our first responders on the scale of Sept. 11 in a while, doesn't mean that the needs are not there. We cannot afford to wait until a tragedy hits to realize that we did not do enough for them. I am glad that this bill recognizes this reality by partly restoring the cuts that the Administration made to the grant programs such as Metropolitan Medical Response System, Firefighter grants, and Emergency Management Performance Grants. I know that my own City of New York is making good use of all these grants, including those provided through the High Threat Urban Areas program, and that they are doing so expeditiously within the accounting requirements of the Department. I do have some concerns about the requirement that part of this funding go toward emergency medical services, because I believe our states and localities should be able to distribute all the funding to where it is needed most. But I hope to work with the Chairman and the Ranking member on these concerns in Conference. In a related account, the bill also restores funding for the Urban Search and Rescue teams that were so crucial to not only our country's response to 9/11, but the devastation caused by last year's hurricanes as well. That is a much-needed restoration. Beyond helping our state and municipalities, I would also like to express my support for the attention that Chairman Rogers and Ranking Member Sabo have paid to balancing new demands on the Department with its ongoing missions. These critical missions, such as stopping the flow of illegal drugs and approving visas, have not gone away since 9/ 11 or since Fox News started sowing paranoia about our southern border. This bill properly recognizes this reality. In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I believe that the bill does a good job within the amount provided for its top line. I would have wished to see more funding provided for all functions across the department, especially for assistance to our first responders. We cannot continue to move the baseline lower and lower year after year, and expect the Department, our states, and our cities to do more with less. Until the Budget Committee passes a realistic budget resolution, however, we must play the cards that we are dealt, and this bill does a good job of that. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.|109900|050524|4|Hcr24my05-98 98.txt|472|474|H3795-H3809|86|15|NA|Speaker|NA|NA|N/A

10920050015553|Mr. Speaker, there are a select few men and women in this world who know in advance the exact time of their death. The crime victims are not in that group. Without time to prepare, they never get to say goodbye for the last time. They never get to hug their kids goodbye, their parents for the last time. The last person they usually see on earth is the killer, the one who steals their life. One of those victims was Pensacola, Florida, police officer Stephen Taylor. He was handcuffing a bank robber that he had captured when another bandit named Clarence Hill cowardly shot Officer Taylor in the back, killing him. This was in 1982, 24 years ago. Hill was tried and sentenced to death, and his sentence was proper. He was to be executed with a date and time predetermined by law. He knew when he was to meet his maker. When at the very last minute he claimed that lethal injection is cruel and unusual punishment, our Supreme Court today agreed that his civil rights might have been violated and stayed the execution indefinitely. The courts have to figure this all out, according to the Supreme Court. Today the Supreme Court's wayward ruling will undo sentences and the sanity of grieving families. Mr. Speaker, has the Supreme Court lost its way? Soon many murderers and child rapists and armed robbers will scurry to have their sentence stopped. They will claim their deaths might be too cruel and unusual. Cruel and unusual they are not. Mr. Speaker, 37 of the 38 States in the United States that use the death penalty use lethal injection, a hardly unusual means of death when most States use it. Note the phrase is cruel and unusual punishment, not cruel or unusual punishment. Lethal injection drugs, those are the same drugs given to surgery patients every day, just in a different dosage. But the people on death row who hope Hill's case will serve their lives have committed crimes more painful than any drug could be, holding someone's head under water, stabbing someone dozens of times till they bleed to death, raping, robbing and bludgeoning their victims until every cry is silenced. Those folks have earned the right to be executed. I spent 22 years as a felony trial judge and 8 years as a felony court prosecutor in Texas. I have probably tried more cases and more death penalty cases than all the Justices on the Supreme Court put together, and I dealt with the Constitution every day, especially the issues of the Bill of Rights. I have been down there in the trial court, down in the mud and the blood and the beer with vicious criminal cases, and I have seen the families of murder victims grieve and pray and hope that justice will occur in their case when some outlaw snuffs out the life of their loved one. The death penalty is proper in proper cases. Some people deserve that punishment. Hill is one of those people. Mr. Speaker, his guilt is not in doubt, just the means of his execution is in doubt, according to the Supreme Court. You know we went from hanging criminals to the electric chair to the gas chamber to the firing squad to this, quote, put them to a quiet peaceful death, the lethal injection. Now those that are more concerned about the way criminals die than they are concerned about the way victims die say this death will be and may be a little painful. This ought not to be. Criminals should not have more rights than victims. This case is 26 years old. That absurd delay in sentencing is cruel and unusual to the family of the victims. Gunning down officer Taylor by shooting him in cold blood is cruel and unusual punishment for him, the victim. Lethal injection for this killer is neither cruel nor unusual, it is just justice. And that's the way it is.|109507|050614|56|Hcr14jn05-114 114.txt|1136|1136|H4415-H4472|39|6|VA|Frank Wolf|H|10|Republican

10920050020481|Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prevent any funding from going to the Fairplex Trade and Conference Center. Fairplex is home to the Los Angeles County Fair, the largest county fair in the world. The fair is a great asset to California, contributing a major portion of the $11.6 million in State sales tax revenue generated by Fairplex and $176 million in spending. The L.A. County Fair Association describes itself as self-supporting and boasts that it does not fall under the auspices of any county or State governmental body. Surplus revenues that are generated by the fair and other activities are reinvested into the maintenance and development of the facility. The association also states that Fairplex receives no government funding for the operation or maintenance of its facilities. However, Fairplex received $1 million in Federal funding for fiscal year 2006. If the money is not used for the operation or maintenance of this thriving independent facility, what is it used for? Maybe the funding is intended for some other activities at the Fairplex, such as the Wally Parks NHRA Motor Sports Museum or the Frank Hawley Drag Racing School. Maybe these funds are for Fairplex Park, a major horse racing facility with a grandstand and air-conditioned clubhouse for satellite gambling. There is no question that Fairplex delivers major economic benefits for L.A. County and the rest of California. But I do question, however, why the Federal Government is throwing money at an independent facility that generates over $334 million in economic activity nationwide. Fairplex does so well, in fact, that it donates more than $400,000 in cash and in kind to local organizations each year. So why are we giving this earmark? That is the question. I reserve the balance of my time.|109037|050628|208|Hcr28jn05-118 118.txt|6424|6432|H5302-H5355|556|102|CA|Barbara Lee|H|9|Democratic

Story after story was brought to me when I worked in the Arizona attorney general's office about people whose lives were destroyed because one member of their family became addicted to gambling. Now, we have regulated gambling in this Nation, and that is one thing and nobody is trying to ban that by this bill. But Internet gambling is totally unregulated gambling, and it victimizes people and it destroys lives. It seems to me that the critics of this bill, including those in the paper this morning, say it does not go after every gambling operation in the world. Of course it doesn't. There are regulated gambling organizations which are legitimate and at least have some government oversight. What this bill goes after is the epidemic of unregulated gambling that is destroying lives that puts a full online casino in every single home in America to corrupt the people there and destroy their lives.

10920050023084|You know what, it is time for Congress to stand up and insist on answers to hard questions. Let me go back to Iraq for one moment. I heard a rumor that the Iraqi prime minister intends to come to Washington soon. I think we all deserve an answer to a question that was raised by one of our leaders in the Democratic Party, Jan Schakowsky, who circulated a Dear Colleague today. Maybe you have not heard this yet, but the Iraqi prime minister, where we have spent close to half a trillion dollars and 2,600 Americans have died, the head of their parliament, Mahmoud al- Mashhadani said these offensive words. He ``accused `Jews' of financing acts of violence in Iraq in order to discredit Islamists who control the parliament and government so they can install their `agents' in power.'' These are his words: ``Some people say `we saw you beheading, kidnappings and killing. In the end we even started kidnapping women who are our honor.' These acts are not the work of Iraqis. I am sure that he who does this is a Jew and the son of a Jew. I can tell you about these Jewish, Israelis and Zionists who are using Iraqi money and oil to frustrate the Islamic movement in Iraq and come with the agent and cheap project.'' This is what my friend from Iowa was earlier talking about democracy? What kind of democracy would tolerate and countenance that kind of virulent, anti-Semitic remark from the Speaker of the parliament? The same Iraqi government that has a bilateral military agreement with Iran. Does this say something about the policy of this administration that has enhanced the power and influence of Iran in the region, Iran by the way, who is the sponsor of Hamas and Hezbollah and we know and the whole world knows what is happening today in Lebanon and the Gaza strip?|109451|050718|1|Hcr18jy05-50 50.txt|18|40|H5918-H5919|1402|234|TN|Marsha Blackburn|H|7|Republican
10920050023990|Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of accusations made about who precipitated the crisis, the charges made that it all occurred because three prisoners were taken, and that Hezbollah and Hamas deliberately provoked the situation. And it may well be true. I have no idea exactly what is true. But there are others who have indicated that they believe that it was precipitated mainly with the intent of our foreign policy, along with Israel's foreign policy, as an initial step to go into Iran. We have talked about Iran around the House and around Washington, and there are a lot of people very, very concerned. Our administration talks about it all the time; taking out Iran, taking out the nuclear sites. But to do that, the theory is that these missiles had to be removed and, in a practical military sense, that seems very reasonable. So there could be the deliberateness of Hamas and Hezbollah precipitating the crisis for whatever gain they think, or deliberately precipitated by both the United States and Israel with the intent to follow up with bombing in Iran. And I am frightened about that. I think that may well occur. I have talked to a lot of military people, a lot of CIA people, who actually believe this is a possibility within months. And this is the reason I have such great concern about what is happening in this area of the country, because if us going into Iraq didn't go so well, can anybody imagine what is going to happen when the bombs start to fall on Iran? I think it is going to be catastrophic. And there has been talk on television this past weekend, the beginning of World War III. And this war is about to spread, and this is the reason that I oppose this resolution, because, deep down in my heart, I believe that what we do here helps to provoke things and agitate things and bring us closer to a greater conflict. And I am just arguing that there is an alternative other than violence to settle some of these problems. Now, a lot of bombs have fallen on both sides, and of course, if they are coming from Lebanon, Syria and Iran are blamed, and they may well deserve the blame. But we haven't talked about who gets the blame for the other side. More people are getting killed on the other side. And as we mentioned before, innocent people are killed, and a lot of nonmilitary targets have been hit, farms and buildings and electrical plants and airports that have nothing to do with the military. And yet the reason I believe this is going to be worse is because we see it in this country the way we want to see it. And we have no willingness to think about how it might be seen elsewhere, like how is it going to be seen by 1 billion Muslims around the world? And you know, quite frankly, every single bomb that is dropped by Israel, by their calculation, and they have reason to believe so, those are U.S. bombs. Those are our airplanes. We paid for them. And they get the money to buy these weapons. So whether it is deliberate or whatever, it doesn't matter. It is the perception by the Muslims who are radicalized by this. You can't deny it. There are more radicals today than there were 2 or 3 years ago. And the reason why I am worried about this is we are now getting the information about the reaction to 9/11. 9/11 occurred, and the immediate response by many of our leaders and the administration said, let's go to Iraq. People would say, well, why Iraq? Well, we have been planning on it all along. This is the opportunity. As soon as this crisis built, we heard very similar comments. Let's go to Iran, you know, to go forward. There are others who suggest that this crisis has come about not out of our strength, but out of our weakness. If Hezbollah and Hamas has deliberately done this, they might have calculated we have been stretched fairly thin around the world and with Iraq, and know that a lot of the American people and the taxpayers are getting tired of the war, so they may have seen this as a sign of weakness on our part. But then the ``neocons'' say, yeah, that may well be true, that is why we have to be tougher than ever. We have got to unleash the bombs. We have got to consider nuclear weapons, and back and forth and back and forth, until one day we are going to get ourselves in such a fix that World War III will be here and it will be irrevocable. And there are some people who sort of like this idea. There are some ``neocons'' who thrive on chaos, because their theory is they want regime change. They want regime change in Syria, and they want regime change in Iran. They wanted it in Iraq. And we are, by gosh, we are going to have regime change, and they are going to be our friends and they are going to be democrats. We are going to have democratic elections. So we go to war and our men and women die. We spend all this money, and we have elections. And then sometimes we don't like the results of the elections, so we ignore them. What if we had elections in Saudi Arabia? What if we had elections in Egypt? And then what if their radicals were elected? So we are fighting and dying to spread democracy. And it is probably one of the most dangerous things for us with our current foreign policy, is that when they do vote and elect Hezbollah and Hamas, then we have to reject the principle of democracy. Self-determination is a great principle, and we should permit it and encourage self-determination. But encouraging elections under these circumstances, and by force, in hopes that we get our man in charge just doesn't work. I think we are going to have regime changes, a lot more regime changes than most people want around here. I think the regime changes are coming in Saudi Arabia, and I think there will be a regime change maybe in Egypt. Who knows? In Libya. And you are going to be very unhappy with those regime changes. So, yes, it was well intended to have regime change in Iraq. But what has it gotten us? And now we want to spread that philosophy and have more regime changes, and who knows what the results are going to be? They are not going to be good. They are going to backfire on us. You know, when Osama bin Laden responded to why, he had a list of reasons on why he encouraged or directed the attack on 9/11. And the one thing that he listed we shouldn't ignore, because as bad as that individual is, and as violent as he is, nobody has ever proven he tells lies. Nobody has ever proven this. Nobody says he is a liar. So we ought to listen to what he says. And one of the reasons that he listed for this was back in 1982, back to the problems we had in Lebanon, there were 18,000 Lebanese and Palestinians killed. And who knows whose bombs and who was doing it? But you know, we were in there, although our troops weren't fighting and we left, but Israel was involved, 18,000. But regardless of whether or not we directed it or wanted it is irrelevant. The conclusion was that we were participants, and it rallied his troops and helped him organize to get people so hateful that they were willing to commit suicide terrorism and come here. Now, we can ignore it and say, well, he is a liar. That is not the reason they did it. But we do that at our own peril. Now, one of the reasons why I believe that it wouldn't be difficult to put the label USA on these weapons, obviously the airplanes have been built here. But what about the money? How much money have we given for weapons? Between 1997 and 2004, and that doesn't even count the last 2 years, we gave over $7 billion in weapons grants. It wasn't a loan. It was a weapons grant. Now, the neat thing about this, this was an economic deal because it was beneficial because under the foreign military financing program that we have, Israel is required to spend 74 percent of that back here. So you are talking about a military-industrial complex, a pretty good deal. You know, we subsidize them, send the money over here, it comes over here, and our arms manufacturers make even more money and then dig a bigger hole for us in foreign policy and contribute to the many problems that we have. And that amount of money, they get $2.3 billion of these military grants, and they automatically increase it $60 million per year. So it is locked in place. Now, you say, well, that is money for our ally. And fine, if it was used for defense, maybe. But if it is used to antagonize 1 billion Muslims and there is no willingness to even consider the fact that we should look at it in a balanced way, and instead it is ridiculed and said, oh, this is ridiculous to think of neutrality or balance and think about both sides, and the innocent people dying on both sides should be considered. So we are moving toward a major crisis, a major crisis financially and a major crisis in our foreign policy. I don't believe we can maintain this. So even if you totally disagree with our aggressive empire building and policing the world, let me tell you, I am going to win the argument, because we are running out of money. We are in big debt, and we are borrowing it. We borrowed $3 billion a day from countries like China and Japan and Saudi Arabia to finance this horrendous debt. And it won't be, it can't be continued. The dollar will eventually weaken. You are going to have horrendous inflation. Interest rates are going to go up, and it is going to be worse than the stagflation of the 1970s. And domestic spending is never curtailed. We have been in charge of the Congress and the Presidency for several years now, and the government gets bigger, probably faster than it was getting before. So we are facing a crisis that is liable to escalate and get out of control in the Middle East. At the same time, it has a bearing on our finances, because when it contributes to the deficit, there is a limit to how much foreigners will loan to us. We have to print the money. We have to go to the Fed, create new money. That is the inflation. And what does it do to the cost of oil? Inflation pushes the cost of oil up. That should be a concern to everybody. And at the same time, the production of the oil didn't work. I mean, the oil production went down in Iraq. What happens if this happens to be true? I actually pray that I am completely wrong about this. And you can say, well, you are, so don't sweat it. But what if I am right? It is frightening, because if this leads to bombing in Iran, look for oil at $150 a barrel. Then the American people will wake up. They will say, hey, what's going on here? Why is gasoline so expensive? It is expensive because we have less production out of Iraq, and it is expensive because the value of the dollar is going down. And it is expensive because they are anticipating that this crisis is not going away, and what we do are antagonizing the world. So, once again, I come to this from a slightly different viewpoint than those who like to pick sides. There is nothing wrong with considering the fact that we don't have to be involved in every single fight. That was the conclusion that Ronald Reagan came to, and he was not an enemy of Israel. He was a friend of Israel. But he concluded that that is a mess over there. Let me just repeat those words that he used. He said, he came to the conclusion, ``The irrationality of Middle Eastern politics forced us to rethink our policy there.'' I would like you to rethink our policy, not only there, but the kind of policy that led to 60,000 people dying in Vietnam and then walking away. And what happened after we walked away? We are better off than ever. We had a naval ship going into Vietnam just recently. We trade with them. We do deals with them. Yet it was a total fiasco and a total loss because of the way we went to war. And this is also the reason that I am determined to persist that if we take our country to war, that we ought to be responsible. We should never send these kids and young people to war without a declaration, win the war, and get it over with. When we don't declare it, it goes on and on and on. We don't win them. And literally, this Persian Gulf War, and this Iraqi war, it has been going on since 1990. We never stopped bombing Iraq, never stopped bugging them, and antagonizing them and inciting them. So it is not a sign of weakness to talk about neutrality. It is a sign of strength that you have a little bit of courage and you believe in your own system. If we want to spread our values, it is a good way to do it. Set a good example. Put our financial house in order. Treat people evenly, and trade with people, and talk to people and travel. But don't think that we can force our values at the point of a gun, and think they are all going to be democratic elected governments that we are going to be pleased with. It is not going to happen. So there is reason to reconsider the total policy that has been followed in this country essentially for 100 years. And it hasn't been productive for us. Essentially, Woodrow Wilson started it. We are going to make the world safe for democracy. And look how safe the world has been since Woodrow Wilson introduced that. We are less safe than ever. And our financial condition is worse than ever. And we are running our program, whether it is our domestic welfare program or our foreign policy, it is being run on borrowed money. It is borrowed money from overseas, and it is also from inflated currency. And we can get away with it for a while longer, but let me tell you, there is a crisis coming, and it is going to be dealing with the dollar and it is going to involve our foreign policy. And then we will, as a sign of weakness, we will have to come home. We will have to come home because we can't afford the empire. It is not wise to have it, and we should have more confidence and more belief that what we have in this country, and what America used to stand for, that we should spread that message more by setting an example and through a voluntary approach. And when that time comes, I think that maybe more people will reconsider it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.|109064|050721|88|Hcr21jy05-78 78.txt|2521|2524|H6221-H6269|193|38|CA|Jane Harman|H|36|Democratic
10920050024274|Mr. Chairman, I oppose the ``Pledge Protection Act'' because of its potential ramification for the judicial process. This legislation seeks to prohibit all federal courts, including the Supreme Court, from hearing any case that challenges the constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance. This legislation is a response to recent challenges in the 9th Circuit Court involving the statement ``under God.'' While I do not agree with the court's decision, we are heading down a slippery slope when we authorize Congress to use its power over the courts to limit jurisdiction of constitutional challenges. This seemingly bipartisan legislation is another attack on our principles of civil liberties and equal protection, just as we saw on yesterday's vote on the ``Marriage Protection Act,'' to please the most extreme of the Republican base. It is not worth undermining our system of checks and balances.

10920050025131|Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 3525, as amended. As amended, this legislation reflects provisions as reported by the Committee on Ways and Means on June 29 and included in H.R. 5640, the Child and Family Services Improvement Act of 2006. I am pleased to be here with the gentleman from Washington who is a cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation. I thank him for his work and leadership on this legislation. I would also like to thank the many Members from both sides of the aisle for their support. Mr. Speaker, this legislation reauthorizes and improves numerous child protection programs that combined, would provide about $4 billion during the next 5 years to keep children safe and ensure they are raised in safe and loving families. These programs are the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program, the Child Welfare Services Program, the Court Improvement Program and the Mentoring Children of Prisoners Program. This legislation supports State efforts to prevent child abuse and neglect by keeping families together and preventing, whenever possible, the unnecessary separation of children from their families. For example, the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program provides resources for family support services, family preservation services, time-limited reunification services and post-adoption services. We know that one of the best ways to give a child a chance of a bright future is to ensure that that child is raised in a safe, loving family. The services supported by this legislation are targeted where they are needed most, to help parents at risk of abusing or neglecting their children or to prevent repeated abuse and neglect. On May 23, the Ways and Means Human Resources Subcommittee, which I chair, held a hearing on this legislation. We heard from a broad array of voices in support of the extension of these programs and in support of changes requiring States to focus resources more on services for children and at-risk families. Earlier this year, the President signed the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, which provided $200 million in new funds for services to better protect children over the next 5 years. I am very pleased that this legislation targets these increased resources so more foster children are visited on a monthly basis. The Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General recently reported that these visits were not occurring. Only 20 States could tell whether the caseworkers actually visited children in foster care on a monthly basis. In seven of these 20 States, the reports found that fewer than half of the children in foster care were visited on a monthly basis. Research shows that children who are visited on a more frequent basis are more quickly placed in permanent homes and experience other positive outcomes, compared to children not visited. Newspapers are frequently reporting the horrors of children neglected by the very system charged to protect them. The increased monitoring promoting by this bill makes sense and would go a long way towards better protecting these vulnerable children. Mr. Speaker, we still have more work to do to improve our Nation's foster care system. Time and time again, we hear of children lingering in foster care, bounced from home to home. In some cases, foster children have lived in more than 50 homes. This is unacceptable, and we will continue to work to improve this program so that all children can live with a family that loves them. This legislation brings us one step closer to that important goal. It has widespread bipartisan support, and I urge all my colleagues to support it. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.|109223|050726|90|Hcr26jy05-61 61.txt|4209|4363|H6477-H6509|7002|1094|MD|Ben Cardin|H|3|Democratic

10920050029164|Mr. Speaker, certainly the fundamental building block of our democracy for the last 208 years has been a constitutionally guaranteed right to vote. Prior to my service in Congress here, I had the great honor and privilege to serve as my State of Michigan's chief election officer and the secretary of State. In that role I viewed it as my duty to ensure the integrity of our elections process, to ensure that every eligible voter had an opportunity to vote, to ensure that every registered voter would turn out on election day, and to root out any fraud, any type of fraud in our elections process, and to ensure that every vote that was cast was properly counted. I would like to think that I do have a deep understanding and certainly a respect for our Nation's electoral process, and not from a partisan tint. In fact, after the 2000 elections, the NAACP gave my administration the Nation's highest grade of any of the secretaries of State in the entire Nation for election reform. Mr. Speaker, since the 2000 election, this Congress has also taken action to improve the process through the Help America Vote Act, that they authorized and appropriated millions and millions and millions of dollars for, which has improved the quality of our voting equipment and improved the registration voter list throughout the Nation. Now, today, we have another positive electoral initiative that will help ensure the integrity of our process. H.R. 4844, the Federal Election Integrity Act, will require voters in Federal elections to show a photo ID to prove their identity and to be sure that their vote is counted. I know that we are hearing concerns from the other side that for very partisan political reasons that this is going to disenfranchise voters, but nothing could be further from the truth. This important reform will ensure that every voter who presents himself at the poll, is who they say they are, and will limit diluting the votes of lawful voters by rooting out fraud. Mr. Speaker, the call for photo identification at the polling places is not simply coming from Republicans. In fact, in my home State of Michigan, during the 2005 Detroit mayoral race, we heard calls there from both candidates, both camps about electoral improprieties that were happening in the city of Detroit. Both of the candidates engaged in that process and in that election were Democrats. In fact, Freeman Hendrix, who lost that close race, actually came out after the election with a litany of things that we needed to do in the State of Michigan for election reform and paramount, a priority amongst them from him, was that we needed to have photo identification. In addition, as has been mentioned on the floor already, the bipartisan Carter-Baker Commission, that is Jimmy Carter, former President Jimmy Carter, the Carter-Baker Commission on Electoral Reform recommended that we require photo ID at the polling places, again to ensure the integrity of our electoral process. I don't think there is anybody in the Nation that would accuse former President Jimmy Carter of being a Republican or a partisan Republican. We need to enact the photo identification requirement. Another problem is that from some estimates, we have as many as 12 million illegal aliens in our Nation. Many of my constituents are concerned that votes of our citizens are being diluted by noncitizens illegally participating in the electoral process. This legislation actually builds on the REAL ID Act, which ensures that no States issue either driver's licenses or State identification cards to illegal aliens, and it assures the validity of the documents which establish the identity and the citizenship of the individuals. This legislation will be yet another safeguard to ensure that those who are in our country illegally, or who are not citizens, do not participate in our electoral process. It also ensures that citizens who do not now have a government-issued photo ID, or cannot afford one, will have access to free, literally free, identification. So there are a lot of reasons as to why people don't vote. Perhaps they think, they are very apathetic, they don't like the negative campaigning, or they don't like their choices of candidate, or they might think that there is too much fraud in the system and that their vote will not count, for whatever reason. I truly believe that enhancing the integrity of the process will be an impetus to show people that their vote does count, that it is going to be counted, that it is going to be counted properly. In fact, this bill has the potential to actually increase voter participation. Mr. Speaker, this is commonsense reform that will make our democracy stronger. I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying legislation.|109900|050926|2|Hcr26se05-24 24.txt|41|47|H8345-H8346|353|57|NA|Speaker|NA|NA|N/A

10920050035052|Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6427 and urge its adoption by the House. The bill changes the way a particular royalty formula under the Bayh- Dole Act. This is the landmark 1980 law that governs protection of patented inventions developed with the assistance of Federal funding. In brief, H.R. 6427 allows small government-owned, contractor-operated laboratories and their affiliated universities or nonprofits to receive a fair percentage of revenue from a successful patent that they license. The bill produces an equitable result for small entities that perform important research in a number of scientific fields, all of which benefits the American people. I commend the gentleman from Iowa for his work on this issue; I urge the House to pass H.R. 6427 for expeditious consideration by the other body.

10920050039422|Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Long-Term Care Trust Account Act of 2006. I am pleased to be joined by my colleague Senator Blanche Lincoln. In the past few years the notion of estate planning has taken on a negative connotation. I am here to introduce a bill that will focus on the positive side of planning for one's future. As the Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I am committed to improving the financing and delivery of long-term care. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimate that national spending for long-term care was almost $160 billion in 2002, representing about 12 percent of all personal health care expenditures. While those numbers are already staggering we also know that the need for long-term care is expected to grow significantly in coming decades. Almost two-thirds of people receiving long-term care are over age 65, with this number expected to double by 2030. For many individuals it will be necessary to find a way to either save for the care needed or purchase long-term care insurance. Long- term care insurance protects assets and income from the devastating financial consequences of long-term health care costs. Today's comprehensive long-term care insurance policies allow consumers to choose from a variety of benefits and offer a wide range of coverage choices. They allow individuals to receive care in a variety of settings including nursing homes, home care, assisted living facilities and adult day care. Some of the most recent policies also provide a cash benefit that a consumer can spend in the manner he or she chooses. Lastly, long-term care insurance allows individuals to take personal responsibility for their long-term health care needs and reduces the strain on state Medicaid budgets. Unfortunately, for many the struggle to pay the immediate costs of long-term care insurance sometimes outweighs the security these products provide. With our national savings rate in steady decline I fear the American middle class is woefully unprepared to meet the coming challenges of their long-term care needs. As we move forward in our effort to help individuals stay financially stable in their later years, we must encourage them to purchase long-term care insurance and save for long- term care services. The Long-Term Care Trust Account Act of 2006 achieves both goals. My legislation will create a new type of savings vehicle for the purpose of preparing for the costs associated with long-term care services and purchasing long-term care insurance. An individual who establishes a long-term care trust account can contribute up to $5,000 per year to their account and receive a refundable ten percent tax credit on that contribution. Interest accrued on these accounts will be tax free, and funds can be withdrawn for the purchase of long-term care insurance or to pay for long-term care services. The bill will also allow an individual to make contributions to another person's Long-Term Care Trust Account. This will help many relatives in our country that want to help their parents or a loved one prepare for their health care needs. It is my hope that this legislation will help all Americans save for their long-term care needs. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this important bill. Thank you, Mr. President. S. 2398.

10920050039861|Mr. President, I will not take the whole 11 minutes. I will do the Senate that favor, anyway. First of all, the Senator is tremendously knowledgeable about the budget. I respect very much what he is saying. I am pleased he recognizes the importance of the underlying thrust of the amendment. My understanding is the function 920 line has about $11 billion in it, so what I am calling for is a reduction of about a quarter in our overhead expenses, travel expenses. That has been done in the past in order to fund important programs. We are in agreement that there is a shortfall in defense. Nothing is more important across the board right now than sustaining at least the President's request. I argue, and perhaps will argue further in this process, that we need to do a little more this year, but we should at least do this, and we can do this with a reduction in overhead that occurs all the time in the private sector. I think we should. Now, the Senator mentioned various efficiencies we can use to make the money go further. I have been a strong supporter of those on the Armed Services Committee. I think there are efficiencies we can gain in terms of leasing and other kinds of measures. I would not want to leave the floor this morning leaving the Senate with the impression that is going to be enough to meet the obligations we have before us for national defense and national security. Remember, we are talking about the security of our homes, our families, our jobs. Remember what the attack on 9/11 did to the economy. We just saw numbers about how revenues were off in the early part of the decade. Well, that was not unrelated to the fact we were attacked. I am not saying we would not have been attacked had we been stronger throughout the 1990s; I am saying that right now, we are too far out on a margin of risk. The further you go on that margin of risk, the greater instability, the greater the lack of confidence in the world, and that hurts our economy. I said substantially the same thing a couple years ago when we were debating the highway bill. I was arguing in favor of bonding for infrastructure investment. Investment in defense, like investment in infrastructure, is not an optional expenditure of the Government. We have, if you want to look at it this way, a deficit in the national defense. As bad as the budget deficit is, I would argue the deficit in the national defense is worse because that deficit imperils both the national security and the economic security of the United States. So we need to make some tough decisions. I agree with the Senator when he says that. We can at least take this decision now. This amendment is offered on a bipartisan basis. And this concern is bipartisan in the Armed Services Committee. When we had what we call our posture hearing, looking at the posture of defense, Senator Inhofe, Senator Dayton, Senator McCain, Senator Lieberman, and I all raised the issue of whether, going forward, we needed a structural increase in the national defense. We are not asking for that here. We are not asking for that this year. We want to do a study of this issue. We want to look at it in a searching and bipartisan way and then report back, I hope next year-- early next year--to the Senate on what we need to do. But right now, we need at least to give the President what he has asked. I would hope we could find a way to go a little further than that in this budget and give the President what he asked for in the fall of 2004, before the Office of Management and Budget got at the Defense projections. That is why I am offering the amendment. I very much appreciate the spirit in which the Senator has responded. I hope he can stretch a point and perhaps find a ``yes'' vote for this amendment, and then debate, in as bipartisan a fashion as possible, the other structural issues we are dealing with with the deficit. I thank the Senate again, Mr. President. I yield the floor.|109082|051215|82|Hcr15de05-112 112.txt|1491|1492|H11845-H11858|69|13|CA|Duncan Hunter|H|52|Republican

10920050045782|Mr. President, this month marks the anniversary of two milestones in Asian Pacific American history. The first-ever Japanese Americans made their home in this country starting on May 7, 1843. And in this same month in 1869, the Transcontinental Railroad, which had a tremendous impact on settling the West, was completed largely due to the hard labor of hundreds of Chinese Americans. These landmarks in Asian Pacific American history inspired Congress in 1977 to pass legislation establishing a week in May as Asian/Pacific Heritage Week. In 1990, it was expanded into a month-long observation. So this May, in recognition of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, I honor the diverse cultures and heritages that make up the Asian and Pacific Islander American communities in my own home State of Maryland and across the Nation. I recognize the adversity and discrimination so many have faced and continue to face in America, and I vow to continue to fight to make sure all Asian Pacific Americans receive the equality they deserve in all aspects of their lives. Asian and Pacific Islander American communities come from all different countries of origin from China, Japan, Laos and the Philippines to Pakistan, Vietnam, Korea, and many others. They have brought with them unique cultural traditions, religions and languages. And they make major contributions to all facets of our society from small businesses to giant corporations, from the government to the front lines of battlefields, schools, athletics, law firms, hospitals, and countless other arenas. For centuries, they have helped make America what it is today, and they continue to be an integral part of the diverse American tapestry. That is why I support comprehensive immigration reform and accessible, efficient immigration services to keep our borders open to the immigrants that continue to make their homes in America and contribute to our culture and economy. Asian Pacific American Heritage Month is a reminder of the contributions this community makes to our society all year round. I will continue to fight in the Senate for the needs of the millions of Asian Pacific Americans that have made their home in this country.|109369|050308|3|Scr08mr05-127 127.txt|130|130|S2230-S2231|3|1|NC|Elizabeth Dole|S|NA|Republican

10920050054761|Mr. President, we are now back on the Homeland Security bill, which is an important piece of legislation as it addresses the issues of how we protect our Nation and how we deal with border security and threats involving potential weapons of mass destruction. It also addresses the issue of the management of the Department of Homeland Security, especially in areas where there have been issues, primarily--well, almost every function of the Department has had some issues, but the ones that have been highlighted, of course, are those dealing with the Katrina catastrophe and FEMA's response to that. It is an important piece of legislation for a variety of issues, but I want to carry on a little bit with the discussion--and then I want to yield to the Senator from Louisiana, who has an amendment, but I want to continue the discussion on the issue which has been raised relative to the report that was put out today, the midsession review. It is important for people to understand we are functioning in a Government that has fairly significant fiscal issues. We came out of the 1990s with the largest bubble in the history of this Nation, the Internet bubble--in the history of the world, honestly. And that bubble burst. That was a bubble in the tradition of the tulip bubble and the South Seas bubble, where basically people were printing money without any support behind it--called stocks. Stocks were being issued that had no value behind them. The stock value ran up, through exuberance, as Chairman Greenspan called it, irrational exuberance. When that burst, it basically took out of the economy huge amounts of liquidity. That was followed, of course, by the attack of 9/11, which was not only a catastrophic event from the loss of life and impact on our culture but also was a catastrophic event economically. The President had the good sense to come forward with proposals which basically tried to address the economic side of the problems which we were confronting. We were headed into a very severe recession as a result of those two events. He proposed tax cuts which have been, I think vilified would be a kind word, from the other side of the aisle. He proposed those tax cuts basically on the theory that if you reduce the tax burden on the American worker to something that is fair, it will generate income because you basically create more incentive for people to be productive. It is human nature. Somebody is going to be able to take action which generates income. If they pay a very high tax on that action, they are going to have very little incentive to take that action. If they pay a reasonable and fair tax on that action, then they will take that action. The capital gains cuts is a classic example of that, where by cutting the capital gains rate we have seen massive amounts of economic activity that would not have occurred before when people would have sat on those assets, stocks, and real estate, or corporate assets. But because there was a lower and more reasonable capital gains rate, people have turned those assets over, which has had two effects. First, it generated a taxable event which generated huge amounts of revenue to our Nation. In fact, the capital gains events have exceeded the expected baseline for those receipts by a factor of almost $100 billion over the last 2 to 3 years. Not only did they create those receipts, but it also took the assets which had been locked up in maybe productive assets but not as productive as they should have been and turned those dollars and those resources and capital investment into things which would be even more productively used because when people sell the assets, they take what they gain and reinvest it in a way which is going to produce even more income. The practical effect of that is the dollars are working more effectively, the economy becomes more lean and more productive, and the result is even more revenue. So the practical event is we have seen a huge increase as a result of the tax cuts which the President put in place with the support of this Congress--the Republican Congress, obviously, and not from the other side of the aisle--we have seen a huge increase in the rate of revenue growth in this country. During the last 2 years, revenue jumped 14 percent last year, and it is up almost another 13 percent in the first part of this year. The effect of that has been that we have seen receipts coming into the Federal Treasury which have reduced the deficit dramatically from what was expected, down from $423 billion to below $300 billion. We are still continuing on that path. It is an extraordinarily positive path. Most of those receipts, ironically, come from corporate America and the higher income quadrant of taxpayers in the American economic system. Those are the folks who are paying more in taxes today--from whom we are getting more tax receipts. We are back to basically the historical level of tax burden in this country--around 18 percent gross domestic product being raised through revenue. The problem we have today is not that we are undertaxed. In fact, we are generating a lot of revenue through overspending. What we need is control of spending. This President has tried to do that on the nondefense discretionary side, but we still need to address the entitlement side of the picture and we need to address, obviously, how we manage catastrophes such as Katrina. That brings me to the second point I wanted to make, and that is the Democratic response to this has traditionally been to get rid of these tax cuts. It is pretty hard to take that position any longer because tax reductions are generating so much revenue. Now their position is they are going to bring up Social Security, and they are going to talk just about Social Security. What a tired prescription that is. What a reflection of bankrupt ideas that is. They are once again trying to scare senior citizens over the issue of Social Security. That has been going on for 40 years. When I was first elected to office, I talked to Tip O'Neill, who was Speaker of the House at that time, about what the Republicans who were serving in the House in the early 1980s were going to hear during the next campaign. He said we are going to hear about three things: Social Security and Social Security and Social Security. That appears to be the new tactic which has been gone back to--bring out the bloody shirt of Social Security and wave it at the Republican Party while ignoring, for example, the fact that we have a very serious problem in the outyears with Social Security and other retirement benefits. The Social Security system has an unfunded liability of approximately $12 trillion over its actuarial life. That is because there are many senior citizens who are going to be taking down Social Security as the baby boom generation retires. What is the reaction on the other side of the aisle? Before any discussion can be pursued on the issue of Social Security, they immediately bring out the bloody shirt: Republicans are going to destroy Social Security; they are going to privatize Social Security; they are going to try to eliminate--``savage'' was the term used by the Democratic leader--savage Social Security. Where are their proposals to address Social Security? Where are their proposals to address any entitlement reform other than to suggest that we raise taxes through their ``paygo'' proposal, which is actually ``taxgo.'' They have no proposal. You can't tax your way out of this problem. In fact, we have the right tax policy in place because we are generating huge revenue. What you need to do is aggressively address the spending side of the ledger. Therefore, I put forward a proposal which is supported by a large number--30 cosponsors--of my colleagues on this side of the aisle which sets out eight different initiatives called ``SOS''--stop overspending--the purpose of which is to get our long-term fiscal house in order. Even though the deficit is coming down probably below even what would be a balanced budget for all intents and purposes if we weren't confronted with a war which we have to fight and the Katrina situation which we are confronted with--in fact, if you took the cost of the war out, which we have to spend because we are confronted with a war on terror, which is for our survival, if we took the cost of Katrina out, we would essentially have a balanced budget next year. That is the fact. But we also have to face the fact that in the outyears when the baby boom generation retires, that is not going to be the case. There will be a huge amount of pressure on us because the cost of sustaining the retirement benefits is going to overwhelm the younger generation's ability to pay for it. We have to put forward an aggressive program to resolve that issue, to make the cost of Government affordable for our children while still delivering quality services to those who retire. We can do it if we think about it and start soon to address it. That is what SOS does. There are eight different proposals to try to accomplish that. I hope that we will take it up and at least aggressively debate it because it is an idea that basically uses the process to push policy, and the policy is what we need. We need to get on that case. At this time, I yield the floor. I understand the Senator from Louisiana has an amendment to offer. We look forward to proceeding with the amendment process relative to the homeland security matter.|109400|050512|255|Scr12my05-111 111.txt|6010|6011|S5014-S5062|59|12|OK|James Inhofe|S|NA|Republican

10920050057355|Mr. President, I rise to offer a compromise and support a compromise. I have agreed to limit my remarks to 7 minutes in the hope, however faint it might be, that people might listen to me. Secondly, I am here to support a compromise. I am here to support a compromise led by our good friend, Chairman Domenici, involving the occupant of the Chair, the Senator from Louisiana, and a distinguished bipartisan group of Senators who are coming together to bring out a compromise that is going to solve a major problem. We hear--on the floor, and wherever politicians gather, and pundits gather, and at coffee shops--people complain about the high cost of gasoline, the high price of natural gas, and our unhealthy dependence on foreign oil. Well, my gosh, they are all right. They are all correct. We are importing over 60 percent of our petroleum. We hear lots of people pontificate about the skyrocketing costs of natural gas, heating homes, and how that affects the need for low- income heating assistance programs, and how it squeezes all of us who, like me, depend upon natural gas to heat a house. Once again they are right. Over the last few years, natural gas prices in America have been some of the most expensive in the world. Some people cry out for the need to do something to reduce these high oil and gas prices. Well, in the past, when it has come down to it, too many people have stood up and said: No, we are not going to do it. The reasons range from ``not in my backyard''--they do not want anything produced right near them, whether it is oil or minerals or a manufacturing process-- that is called the NIMBY approach. Others are pushing environmental concerns to the extreme, not realizing that modern-day exploration of oil and gas is done with new techniques that are designed to be as friendly to the environment as possible. Then of course, there are others who think that high gas prices make a great campaign issue in an election year, and that it is in their best interest to do nothing before November. Well, there is a way to begin to reduce the price of oil and natural gas; and that is to increase domestic supplies. Let me point out to my colleagues that for all the laws we pass, we have not been able to repeal the law of supply and demand. If you have more demand than you have supply, the cost goes up. And that is what we have. Now, we are trying to reduce the demand by conservation, but people continue to make choices, and the economy grows. Not only our economy grows, but the economies of India and China, which are putting real pressure on demand, grow faster. But we are not keeping up with the demand from production in the United States. Thus, our percentage of contribution to supply continues to decline. The area specified in S. 3711 will open up 8.3 million acres of the Outer Continental Shelf for oil and gas leasing as soon as practicable, but no later than one year from the date of enactment. This area, which includes Lease 181 and an area south of Lease 181, is estimated to contain roughly 1.26 billion barrels of oil and 5.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. The natural gas supply alone made available under this bill is enough to heat and cool 6 million homes for 15 years. That is a good start. We would like to have more, but with the demand for energy so high, and the supply limited, we need to take what steps we can. With the price of gasoline over $3 a gallon, all of us are looking at the need to conserve, and that is one way we can make a difference: stop driving so much, carpool, walk. People still get there. I used to walk to school, ride a bicycle to school. That is not a bad idea for a lot of kids. It keeps you in better shape. In addition to the growing demand for energy, disruptions in supply due to geopolitical instability in the middle east and South America have caused energy prices to spike upward. All of these factors have caused the price of gasoline to increase by over 125 percent since 2000. As fighting continues in the Middle East and political instability remains in South America and North Africa, energy analysts warn that $100 barrel oil could indeed be a reality in the future. The situation with natural gas is no different. To say that we are in a natural gas crisis is an understatement. Why is this the case? Again, the answer is quite simple. Over the years demand for natural gas has skyrocketed while domestic supplies have dwindled. And when that happens, simple economics tells us that prices soar as they have in recent years for natural gas. We have a lot of demand for natural gas because of the increasing demand for this resource in the generation of electricity. More and more electric utility generation plants have been forced to switch to natural gas. Natural gas is also in short supply because of all the restrictions on its production and delivery, including restrictions on access to these gas supplies and strict environmental regulations, which have pushed a massive expansion of natural gas usage as opposed to the use other energy resources such as coal. According to a Wall Street Journal editorial, there has been a 40- percent increase in the use of natural gas since 1986, and that accounts for nearly 25 percent of our energy. And it is set to increase by another 40 percent by 2025. We cannot afford to do that. Our production of natural gas has fallen from 19.2 trillion cubic feet to 18.2 trillion cubic feet. That is a 7.2-percent decline. We cannot afford to do that. We need to liquefy and gasify coal so coal gas can fit in, too. That is some ways down the line. But in the meantime, we have to go ahead with lease 181 and the adjacent areas. Price increases hurt our economy. They hurt people who drive cars. U.S. consumers spent $200 billion on natural gas in 2005, which is four times as much as we spent in 1999. This has caused both Federal Reserve Chairmen Greenspan and Bernanke to repeatedly warn that ``natural gas bottlenecks endanger economic expansion'' and ``pose risks to both economic activity and inflation.'' High natural gas prices cost us manufacturing jobs. The National Association of Manufacturers says that roughly 3 million manufacturing jobs have been lost due in large part to natural gas price increases. Chemical plants are moving overseas along with and fertilizer plants. According to the U.S. Chemistry Council, it is estimated that from 2000 to 2005, the chemical industry saw the loss of 100,000 jobs and $50 billion to overseas competition. Furthermore, the magazine Business Week reported that of the 120 major chemical facilities in the planning and construction stages around the world, only one is in the United States--50 plants are going up in China. Job loss due to increased natural gas prices has also had a devastating impact on the fertilizer industry because natural gas is a key component in the production of nitrogen fertilizer. Late last year, Ford B. West of the Fertilizer Institute informed the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior that sixteen U.S. production facilities have closed permanently and an additional five have been idled due to rising natural gas prices--this represents a 35 percent decline in U.S. fertilizer production The agricultural sector is also taking it on the chops. The president of the Missouri Farm Bureau, Charlie Kruse, on March 17, 2005, testified that in the last 4 years, the retail nitrogen fertilizer prices, because of the shortage of the supply of natural gas, have skyrocketed from $100 per ton to $350 per ton. These are real costs being put on our farmers. Analysis from the Food and Agricultural Policy Institute, FAPRI, at the University of Missouri-Columbia indicates that fertilizer prices paid by agricultural producers increased by almost 50 percent between 2002 and 2006, with fuel prices increasing over 100 percent in the same time frame. This leads to cost increases of over $80 per acre for rice, $50 per acre for corn and $10 to $25 per acre for soybeans, wheat and cotton. Farmers are hurting. These increased costs are going to curtail the availability of our food supply and raise the cost of our food as well. Transportation costs will also rise. Well, the concern has been raised by the distinguished Senator from New Mexico that this legislation is not the best deal. I might agree with him, but I will tell you something. Standing here on the floor of the Senate, it is the best looking one of the whole ugly bunch because I have been waiting for a long time to find a way to increase the supply of oil and gas produced in the United States. This is a start. He has pointed out, we need to do a lot more things. Well, I will be there to support whatever we can do to make a reasonable compromise to overcome the objections, so we can start producing gas in deep sea offshore drilling. I hope one of these days we can go back up to the barren reaches above the Arctic Circle in ANWR. I have been up and watched them drill in Prudhoe Bay. There is no harm to the environment. I will tell you, the caribou and the birds love it. The mosquitos are great. They are just as healthy as they are in southern Alaska. Tapping the energy resources in the areas specified in this bill can have an immediate impact on both the price of oil and natural gas because these areas are located in the Gulf of Mexico near existing oil and gas production infrastructure. With its proximity to major oil and natural gas transport terminals and pipelines, these new energy resources could be quickly shipped to the market for use. Well, in closing, I commend Senator Domenici for putting together a bipartisan group to support this bill. I laud his efforts. It is going to be done in an environmentally friendly manner. Last year's devastating category 5 hurricane did not cause any significant oil or gas spillage. And this new technology can produce this oil and gas from offshore areas in an environmentally friendly manner and begin to break the logjam where supply cannot keep up with demand. I urge my colleagues to support S. 3711.|109009|050609|51|Scr09jn05-149 149.txt|963|964|S6245-S6284|72|11|AL|Jeff Sessions|S|NA|Republican

The legislative clerk read as follows: There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill. Mr. SUNUNU: Mr. President, I support passage of H.R. 4709, the Telephone Records and Privacy Protection Act of 2006. This bill gets to the center of the practice known as ``pretexting''--a fraudulent technique to obtain access to confidential communications records--by imposing Federal criminal penalties on perpetrators. There is one point that I would like clarification and assurance. This bill adopts a very broad definition of an ``IP-enabled voice service.'' That definition is broader than just replacements for traditional telephone service, and sweeps in many potential new applications. In my view this definition would be inappropriate in many other contexts. For instance, the Commerce Committee crafted a narrower definition when considering S. 1063, the IP Enabled Voice Communications and Public Safety Act. It is my understanding--and I ask if the distinguished chairman shares this understanding--that this broad definition applies only to this bill, and is not meant to be an indication of the Congress's view of the appropriate scope of voice-over-Internet-Protocol or VoIP services for other purposes or to serve as precedent for future action. It is certainly not meant to suggest that the FCC adopt this definition as it considers the appropriate views on VoIP services.

10920050066117|Mr. President, I wish to make an important note regarding a provision in the conference agreement on H.R. 5682, the Henry J. Hyde United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act of 2006. The conferees on this legislation believe that one of the most important aspects of renewed nuclear cooperation with India will be the new safeguards agreement it enters into with the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, that would apply to its expanded list of declared civilian nuclear sites, facilities, and locations. The administration's original legislation concerning India, which I introduced as S. 2429 on March 16, 2006, stated with regard to this matter that the President had to determine that ``an agreement has entered into force between India and the IAEA requiring the application of safeguards in accordance with IAEA practices to India's civil nuclear facilities.'' As a part of the committee's consideration of the administration's proposal, I asked a number of questions for the record regarding this new safeguards agreement. Secretary Rice stated in response to a question asked in April of this year regarding India's new safeguards agreement that: In March of this year, Senator Biden asked Under Secretaries Robert Joseph and Nicholas Burns how they interpreted certain Indian statements regarding their new safeguards agreement, specifically India's contention that it will be ``India-specific.'' They stated: In November 2005, I asked Under Secretary Joseph what kinds of safeguards will be applied to India's declared civil sites, facilities, and locations. He responded that: In view of these responses, and since S. 2429 contained similar language, the Senate's India bill, S. 3709, specified with regard to India's safeguards agreement, and the determination the President had to make regarding it, that ``an agreement between India and the IAEA requiring the application of safeguards in perpetuity in accordance with IAEA standards, principles, and practices to civil nuclear facilities, programs, and materials . . . has entered into force and the text of such agreement has been made available to the appropriate congressional committees.'' The conference agreement before us today does not include the language from the S. 3709 regarding this element of the Presidential determination required to use the waiver authority we grant. Rather, the conference agreement provides in section 104 that ``India and the IAEA have concluded all legal steps required prior to signature by the parties of an agreement requiring the application of IAEA safeguards in perpetuity in accordance with IAEA standards, principles, and practices, to India's civil nuclear facilities, materials, and programs . . . including materials used in or produced through the use of India's civil nuclear facilities.'' The conferees were assured by administration officials that the language referring to ``all legal steps'' includes approval by the IAEA Board of Governors. The conferees understand that safeguards agreements are signed after Board of Governors' approval, but that entry into force can take additional time. Since Board of Governors' approval would mean that the text of the safeguards agreement would be final, and it is unlikely that either the IAEA or India would sign an agreement that is not final, conferees agreed to this language. The conferees' intent was to secure as final a text as possible for congressional review since the text of the new Indian safeguards agreement would be submitted to Congress as a part of the Presidential determination and waiver authority contained in section 104 of this conference agreement. It is the view of the conferees that this language means that Congress will receive the final text of such an agreement as a part of the President's determination.   &lt;bullet&gt; Mr. BIDEN. The Senate will shortly take a momentous step in U.S.-India relations by passing the conference report on H.R. 5682, the Henry J. Hyde United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act of 2006. Enactment of this legislation brings us much closer to the day when India will resume peaceful nuclear commerce, despite its status as a state that has nuclear weapons and has never been a state party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. It will help bring India into the global nuclear nonproliferation system. It also helps to remove a major irritant in the relations between our two countries. This bill is a tremendous victory for U.S.-India relations. And it increases the prospect for stability and progress in South Asia and the rest of the world. It has become cliche to speak of the U.S.-India relationship as a bond between the world's oldest democracy and the world's largest democracy--but this cliche is also a fact. Shared political values are the foundation for our relationship, a firm belief in the dignity of man and the consent of the governed. Senator Lugar and I yield to no one in our commitment to nuclear nonproliferation. We have taken great care, in this legislation, to protect the role of Congress and of the international institutions that enforce nuclear nonproliferation. This legislation was the result of hard compromises--compromises between our two countries and between Congress and the executive branch. The end result, however, was overwhelming bipartisan support, in both the House and the Senate. That level of broad, solid, bipartisan buy-in was absolutely essential when crafting legislation with such long-term impact on vital American interests. I want to pay special tribute tonight to the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Lugar of Indiana, for his tremendous contribution to securing that broad, bipartisan consensus. The administration originally proposed legislation that would have effectively taken away the power of Congress to review an agreement for nuclear cooperation with India, and Senator Lugar was under great pressure to accept that proposal. He did not do that. Instead, he held four hearings--three open and one closed--that allowed all sides to express their views and that enabled Senators from both parties to raise their concerns with the approval procedure that the administration had proposed. Then he and I worked to craft a Senate bill that passed by a vote of 16-2 in committee and 85-12 on the floor of the Senate. Senator Lugar performed a signal service to our country when he added title II to this legislation, the implementing legislation for the U.S. Additional Protocol with the International Atomic Energy Agency. It is fitting that this legislation has been combined with the India nuclear bill, since part of the nuclear deal is for India to negotiate its own Additional Protocol with the IAEA. It will also be a notable benefit to U.S. nuclear nonproliferation policy when the United States finally ratifies its Additional Protocol, giving our country greater credibility as it presses other countries to allow the IAEA to increase its inspections of their nuclear programs. Ratification of the U.S.- IAEA Additional Protocol was long delayed, and Senator Lugar's leadership on this issue was absolutely vital to this final, successful conclusion. In conference with the House of Representatives, Senator Lugar and I once again worked for a measure that could gain broad support from the Senate. We worked with the House conferees to craft a bill that embodied the best ideas from each house of Congress. At the same time, we worked with the Administration to reach agreement on a wide range of issues, without sacrificing the principles that each house had written into its legislation. We and the other conferees chose substance over rhetoric. The result is a conference report that will command the same broad, bipartisan support today that was demonstrated in the Senate 3 weeks ago. I would like also to acknowledge the staff members who have contributed to the success of this legislation. On the Senate side, the Foreign Relations Committee was most ably served by Ken Myers III, Thomas Moore, Edward Levine and Brian McKeon. Mr. Stephen Rademaker of the majority leader's staff was also an important contributor to our efforts. On the House side, the conferees were most ably served by Douglas Seay, David Fite and David Abramowitz, among others. The U.S.-India agreement is much more than just a nuclear deal. I believe historians will see this as part of a dramatic and positive departure in the U.S.-India relationship that was begun by President Clinton and continued by President Bush. In a time when relationships between states are critically important in shaping the world in which we live, no relationship is more important than the one we're building with India. There is still much to be done in India, as a stable and secure India is very much in America's national interest. We should work to help India increase its energy production, combat terrorism, and guard against epidemics of infectious diseases. We should help both India and Pakistan to ease tensions between their countries and, someday, to walk back from the nuclear precipice. And India should continue its progress toward the front rank of world leaders, and especially of leaders in combating the proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Enactment of this bill today helps both countries to keep moving on the path of cooperation for a better world. In conclusion, I would like to turn to an issue raised recently by some experts, whether the legislation before us, by citing a particular IAEA document, might undermine the principle of perpetuity of safeguards in India. My view is that the IAEA document makes a real contribution to our understanding of safeguards perpetuity. The document cited by this legislation appears in section 104, the second determination that the President will have to make when submitting a U.S.-India agreement for nuclear cooperation to the Congress. It is an IAEA Board of Governors memo cited as GOV/1621 of 20 August 1973. We have been given permission to publish this document, so I will ask that it be printed in the Record at the end of these remarks. The Board of Governors memo makes clear that safeguards on nuclear material will extend until that material no longer has any possible nuclear weapons use, or until it is exchanged with an equal amount of previously unsafeguarded material, or until it leaves the country--in which case safeguards may continue elsewhere. In other words, if you move some imported fuel or equipment to a new location, that location becomes subject to safeguards. The memo also makes clear that safeguards on ``nuclear material, equipment, facilities or non-nuclear material'' supplied to a nuclear facility will apply as well to fissile material ``produced, processed or used in or in connection with'' a safeguarded facility. In other words, any fissile material produced by a safeguarded facility becomes subject to safeguards even after it leaves that facility. Until that output no longer has any possible nuclear weapons use, safeguards follow it; that is a real example of perpetuity of sanctions. At the same time, perpetuity does not mean that a facility will be subject to safeguards until the end of time. A facility can be decommissioned so that it, too, no longer has any possible nuclear weapons use. Or, if the only reason for safeguards is that the facility has imported equipment or material, removal of all such equipment or material from the facility could render it eligible for removal from safeguards. Thus, India's reprocessing plant is safeguarded when it handles spent fuel from imported uranium, but not when India is using it to reprocess spent fuel made from domestic uranium. That is the way safeguards have worked for years in India. The Government of India has announced that eight more of its existing power reactors will be declared as civil and opened to IAEA inspection. India would gain great credibility if it were to let those reactors be inspected even if they use domestic nuclear fuel. Indian officials have suggested, however, that they may insist upon the right to remove those reactors from safeguards if foreign fuel supplies are cut off, and the safeguards agreement that India negotiates with the IAEA may allow for that. There is precedent for such an arrangement, in states that do not have full-scope safeguards, and it would be up to the IAEA Board of Governors, of which the United States is a member, to decide whether that arrangement was permissible in this case. It would be up to Congress and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, of course, to consider whether that sort of safeguards arrangement was sufficient to warrant authorizing peaceful nuclear commerce with India. And it would be up to the executive branch to determine whether to authorize a particular export to India, in light of the safeguards that would govern the facility for which the export was requested. India has also said that many new power reactors will be put under IAEA safeguards. If those reactors are foreign-built, like the Tarapur reactor, there will be no way that they can be withdrawn from safeguards unless they are decommissioned. If they are domestic designs but use some foreign equipment, there will be no way to withdraw them from safeguards without first removing the foreign equipment. And if foreign equipment should be used in one of the eight domestically built reactors that are put under safeguards, then that equipment, too, would have to be removed before that reactor could be removed from safeguards. As a matter of principle, then, perpetuity in safeguards applies more to material and equipment than it does to a whole facility, unless that facility is foreign-built. In practice, however, the only reactors that India might pull out of its safeguards regime would be the eight newly- safeguarded ones, and I believe that the only time that this might occur would be if India were to come under sanctions because of improper nuclear activities or weapons proliferation. In such a case, the regime for nuclear cooperation with India would likely be collapsing anyway.

10920050068477|Mr. President, today I rise with a heavy heart to honor the life of SGT Arthur Ray McGill. It is the story of a carefree and loving young man from northwest Arkansas, who was devoted to his family and always put them above all else. It is also the story of a trustworthy and brave soldier, who honorably served his Nation in uniform, and ultimately gave his life in the name of freedom. Sergeant McGill spent most of his childhood in the small Arkansas town of Decatur. Those who knew him best would describe him as a quiet and patient young man who was always considerate of others and treated them with respect. He attended Decatur High School and although he left after his 10th grade year, he went on to earn his general educational development diploma at the age of 17. Soon after, he joined the Arkansas National Guard, where he would serve for 6 years prior to enlisting in the U.S. Army in November of 2002. In his free time, ``Ray'' or ``Big Country,'' as he was known to friends and family, had a love for archery and could often be found playing video games or reading the comic books of his favorite superhero, Spiderman. But above all, his greatest love was his family, particularly his 7-year old daughter Kaylee. Her welfare was her father's greatest concern, and she knew that he could always be counted on to protect and care for her as best he could. Sergeant McGill reported for duty in January of 2003 and was deployed for service in Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was one of the soldiers in the initial waves of American troops into Baghdad, and served in the area until that August. Sergeant McGill returned to Iraq in January of 2005. In explaining his decision to reenlist for a second tour of duty to his loved ones, Sergeant McGill spoke of his feeling of being needed in Iraq, and that he was simply doing his part and was proud to do so. He would also speak of his future after the Army, when he hoped to study criminal justice, buy a home, and become a member of the U.S. Border Patrol in New Mexico. Throughout his military service, Sergeant McGill's hard work and dependability quickly earned him the respect and loyalty of his fellow soldiers. They even began calling him ``Tizzley,'' a combination of a teddy bear and a grizzly, which aptly described the 6'6'' soldier who had a heart of gold. Though the comradeship with his fellow soldiers grew, Sergeant McGill was still a world away from his family and they were never far from his mind. While in Iraq, he had a habit of sending gifts and money back home to provide for them and spoke to them often by phone or through instant messenger on his computer. To make him feel a little closer to home, he also brought a CD-ROM to Iraq, which he spent a good deal of his free time enjoying; it contained over 500 issues of ``The Amazing Spiderman'' and was never far from his side. Tragically, Sergeant McGill was killed on July 19 when a roadside bomb exploded near his vehicle while he was patrolling through the streets of Baghdad. Back in Arkansas, friends and family came to show their respects and bid farewell to their fallen soldier, as his flag- draped coffin was buried at Fayetteville National Cemetery. Kaylee, who had been the love of her father's life, was presented with an American flag and her father's dog tags, as well as the Bronze Star and Purple Heart he had earned through his courageous service to our Nation. Although her father may no longer be with us, I am hopeful that these items will forever remind her of the courageous and honorable way he lived his life. Words cannot adequately express the sorrow felt in the hearts of the family and loved ones of Arthur Ray McGill, but I pray they can find solace knowing that his spirit will forever live on in the examples he set and the many lives he touched.|109028|050915|1|Scr15se05-194 194.txt|19|76|S10110-S10111|3809|690|AR|Blanche Lincoln|S|NA|Democratic
10920050070202|Mr. President, those of us who are privileged to serve in the Senate literally cast thousands of votes during the years we spend here. Some votes are procedural in nature and of little consequence. Others are far more meaningful. Katrina relief, pension reform, and trade agreements come to mind. Once in a great while, though, we are called upon in this body to cast a vote of such importance to our Nation that it will resonate for years to come--whether to authorize the use of military force against another nation or whether to impeach a President. There are few votes, however, we will cast in our time here that are likely to leave a more lasting impact on America than the one we will cast tomorrow morning. In confirming the nomination of John Roberts--something that is all but certain--we not only will authorize him to serve as the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, we will also make him the leader of the judicial branch of our Government. God willing, he will hold that post for as long as most of us in the Senate are likely to live. A great deal is riding on this vote for our country and its people, both today and for a long time to come. For many of us, this one is a close call. Understandable concerns have been raised on a number of fronts about what kind of Chief Justice John Roberts ultimately will make. Do the writings of a young man in his twenties reflect the views of this 50-year-old man today? If not, why was he reluctant to clearly say so publicly when given that opportunity? Why did the current administration refuse to allow any scrutiny of the writings of Judge Roberts from when he served as the No. 2 person in the Solicitor General's Office of former President Bush? What direction would Chief Justice Roberts seek to lead the Supreme Court in the coming years on issues relating to privacy, to civil rights, and to the prerogatives of the Congress to set policy that may be at odds with the views of State and local governments? How will Judge Roberts seek to interpret and apply the Constitution and a wide variety of laws, both State and Federal? Will the Roberts Court respect precedent or aggressively seek to establish new ones? The honest answer to most of these questions is that none of us really know for sure--not the President, probably not even Judge Roberts himself. That uncertainty explains at least in part why this vote is so difficult for many Members of this body. So we are asked to make a leap of faith. For some, that leap is large. For others, it is not. For myself, I have decided to take that leap of faith. After a great deal of deliberation, conversations with many Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, as well as with others back home and here, I have decided to vote tomorrow to confirm the nomination of John Roberts to serve as our Nation's Chief Justice. Time will determine the wisdom of that decision, along with the decisions of each of our colleagues who join me in casting our votes tomorrow. Yesterday, I had the privilege of meeting with Judge Roberts in my office. There, we discussed many of the concerns and question marks I mentioned just a few minutes ago. His responses were forthright. They were insightful. And I believe they were sincere. Our conversation also provided me with insights into how a young man from a small town in Indiana could grow up, attend Harvard, become one of the most admired lawyers in America, be nominated for the Supreme Court, not once but twice, and then sit through 3 days of often grueling questioning before the Senate Judiciary Committee, responding calmly and respectfully to questions on a wide range of legal issues without the benefit of any notes or even a pad of paper. Judge Roberts and I spoke with one another at length about our respective childhoods and of our parents and the roles they played in our lives and the values they instilled in us and in our siblings. We also talked about our educational opportunities, our careers, our mentors, our spouses, and even about the children we were raising. It was a revealing and encouraging conversation. It was a revealing and encouraging conversation in that it provided me with important insights into his personal values and with a measure of reassurance on the direction he may ultimately seek to lead the highest Court of our land. I shared with him that in the 8 years before coming to the Senate, I served as Governor of Delaware. In that role, I nominated dozens of men and women to serve as judges in our State courts, several of whom enjoy national prominence given my State's role in business and corporate law. Ironically, and I think wisely, Delaware's Constitution requires overall political balance on our State's courts. For every Democrat who is nominated to serve as a judge, Delaware Governors must nominate a Republican, and vice versa. The result has been an absence of political infighting and a national reputation for Delaware's State judiciary regarded by some as the finest of any State in our land. The qualities I sought in the judicial nominees I submitted to the Delaware State Senate included these: unimpeachable integrity, a thorough understanding of the law, a keen intellect, a willingness to listen to both sides of a case, excellent judicial temperament, sound judgment, and a strong work ethic. In applying those standards to Judge Roberts, I believe he meets or exceeds all of them. To my knowledge, no one has questioned his integrity, his intellect, or his knowledge of the law. Democrats and Republicans alike watched, along with a national audience, as Judge Roberts fielded any number of tough questions over the 3 days of hearings and responded knowledgeably, respectfully, with humility, and occasionally with self-deprecating good humor. In all candor, I am not sure any of us would have done as well. Having said that, though, questions and doubts remain about where Chief Justice Roberts will come down on a number of issues-- reproductive rights, civil rights, and respect for congressional prerogatives, to mention a few. I might add that, if truth be known, all of those doubters are not liberal Democrats. Some of them are conservative Republicans. The answers to these questions will come in the years ahead as Chief Justice Roberts assumes this important post and begins to lead this Court and the judicial branch of our Government. In the end, some of the decisions he helps to formulate may surprise and confound people on all sides of the political spectrum. That is something one of his earliest mentors, Judge Henry Friendly of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, has done for years. Let me pause and ask my colleagues today to think back just for a moment. How many of us would ever have imagined that a Texas Congressman and Senator with Lyndon Johnson's early civil rights record would go on to champion the civil rights of minorities like no other American President in the 20th century? Who among us, watching former Representative and Senator Richard Nixon, a Cold War warrior for decades, would have foreseen the role he played in opening the door for U.S. relations with Communist China? Then, too, recall, if you will, the loathing many conservatives came to feel toward the late Chief Justice Earl Warren, a nominee of President Eisenhower, or the disdain many liberals came to feel toward former Justice ``Whizzer'' White, a nominee of President Kennedy. The truth is that life and its experiences do change us and some of our views in ways that cannot always be predicted. Having children of our own and later welcoming those children into our lives as well as learning from our mistakes and from the mistakes of others can combine to make us wiser, to temper our views, to broaden our horizons and deepen our understanding of the views of others with whom we share this planet. And so it is likely to be with Judge Roberts. As I prepare to take a leap of faith tomorrow--albeit not a reckless one, in my view--let me close with a few words of advice, respectfully offered, to our President. A second nomination looms just around the corner. President Bush's choice of that nominee is, in many respects, as important as this one. The next choice can divide this Congress and our country even further or it can serve to bring us a little closer together. We need a choice that unites us, not one that divides us further. We also need a choice that reflects the diversity of this country in which we live. There are any number of well-qualified women, and maybe even a few men, who would be a good choice for the seat now held by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. On behalf of all of us, Mr. President, let me encourage you to send us one of those names. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.|109103|050928|107|Scr28se05-159 159.txt|5047|5182|S10529-S10578|8781|1533|DE|Thomas Carper|S|NA|Democratic

10920050079199|Mr. President, the Senator from Alabama is correct. I would say that we should not make too much of these nuance opinions and disagreements. In one sense, they are important; but in another sense, you have to balance that against the fact that there was a mountain of evidence in different areas that all add up to the same proposition. And add to that--some of that turned out not to be correct--but add to that the element of judgment. This can't be overemphasized. Intelligence analysts apply judgments and common sense to the evidence that they have. Because the evidence is rarely black and white, you very rarely get the bad guy to say, I will tell you everything I know, and it is everything you need to know about this. So you have to exercise judgment. After the first gulf war, we later learned that Saddam Hussein was about 6 months away from having a nuclear weapon program. That is fact No. 1. Fact No. 2: Throughout the ensuing decade, he hid his programs. He tried to deceive the inspectors. He refused to comply with U.N. resolutions to release information. One could, therefore, surmise--or at least it would not be a bad presumption to engage in--that if he had it at one point, or almost had it, we had evidence he was trying to get it. Again, he was hiding the ball at every opportunity. The intelligence analysts have to say, Which way am I going to presume this, that he does or that he doesn't? They concluded that there is every indication that we had better assume that he does. The policymakers have to take that a step further. We say they are not absolutely certain; they are pretty sure, but they are not absolutely certain which way we should flop on this. Should we flop to the direction of inaction? Let's wait until we have absolute proof before we do anything, or go the other way? This is pretty dangerous business. If, in fact, he has, we had better act now before it is too late. We think we will take the action that is based upon the proposition that he will have it. That is a judgment that we engaged in. As my colleague, the Senator from Arizona, so eloquently has pointed out, the choice was when, not if, we would face Saddam Hussein. The question was, would we do it on his terms or on ours? We chose to do it on ours. The result is Saddam Hussein today stands trial for mass murder. The Iraqi people have an opportunity for freedom, and we have an opportunity to transform that region of the world into one that supports peace and opposes evildoers and terrorists as opposed to one which was a hot bed when Saddam Hussein was in charge.|109022|051118|22|Scr18no05-215 215.txt|511|551|S13292-S13297|2582|473|AZ|Jon Kyl|S|NA|Republican

10920050080651|Mr. President, today the Senate was presented with a false choice on the conference report to H.R. 3199, the USA PATRIOT Act. That is why I voted against the motion to invoke cloture. There is a better way that gives us the time we need to thoughtfully debate some very weighty constitutional and civil liberty issues. With 90 percent of the PATRIOT Act already permanently authorized, we can and should extend the provisions expiring on December 31, 2005, for 3 months. Let me be clear, those of us advocating for a 3-month extension support reauthorizing the PATRIOT Act. What we want to do is keep the law intact, exactly as it is right now, so that we can more carefully debate these important matters without feeling rushed by the impending adjournment of this session of Congress. Like almost everyone in this Chamber, I voted for the PATRIOT Act shortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks. I believed the PATRIOT Act would bolster the ability of Federal authorities to conduct criminal and intelligence investigations, to bar and expel foreign terrorists from the United States, to separate terrorists from their sources of financial support, to punish acts of terrorism, and to assist victims of the events of September 11. While I had reservations about some parts of this legislation, the need to address the obvious threat, combined with the fact that many of the more untested provisions in the act were set to expire on December 31, 2005, prompted me to vote for the bill. The provision of greater investigative authority to our Nation's law enforcement officials is a matter that raises many issues, most particularly, the need to balance Government power and civil liberties. Certainly, there is a great onus upon the Department of Justice, DOJ, to utilize the awesome authority of the PATRIOT Act in a circumspect and cautious manner. At the same time, Congress has a responsibility to conduct vigorous oversight on the use of the PATRIOT Act's powers and to carefully debate any changes to these powers. In the spring, in anticipation of the impending need to reauthorize the sunsetting provisions of the PATRIOT Act, I cosponsored S. 737, the Security and Freedom Enhancement, SAFE, Act of 2005. This thoughtful, bipartisan legislation was introduced by Senator Craig on April 6, 2005, and seeks to revise and improve--not eliminate--several of the more controversial provisions of the PATRIOT Act, including roving wiretaps, sneak-and-peek searches, and FISA orders for library and other personal records. Many of the proposed revisions to the PATRIOT Act in S.737 were ultimately incorporated in some form into S. 1389, the Senate version of the PATRIOT Act reauthorization. S. 1389, the USA PATRIOT Act Terrorism Prevention Reauthorization Act, passed by unanimous consent in July and the Senate immediately appointed conferees so that the House and the Senate could begin discussing their very different visions of the reauthorization. Unfortunately, the House waited until November to appoint its conferees, which in large part is why we are now in the position of having very little time to debate and resolve the differences between the two bills. The Senate's version of the PATRIOT Act attempted to deal with many of the civil liberties issues that have come to the fore since the passage of the PATRIOT Act. In particular, S. 1389 would require that the Department of Justice convince a judge that a person is connected to terrorism or espionage before obtaining their library records, medical records, or other sensitive information. It would require that targets of sneak-and-peek searches are notified within 7 days, instead of the undefined delay that is currently permitted under the PATRIOT Act. The Senate bill also would prohibit the issuance of ``John Doe'' roving wiretaps, which identify neither the person nor the place to be put under surveillance. Additionally, S. 1389 would give the recipient of an order for sensitive personal information the right to challenge the order in court on the same grounds they could challenge a grand jury subpoena, as well as provide a right to challenge the gag order that currently prevents people who receive a request for records from speaking out even if they feel the Government is violating their rights. The legislation also requires increased reporting by the DOJ on its use of PATRIOT Act powers and sets a 4-year sunset on three provisions regarding roving wiretaps, business record orders, and ``lone wolf'' surveillance. Unlike the Senate bill, the House version proposed to permanently reauthorize all but two of the expiring provisions--instead it sunsets FISA orders for library and other personal records and the roving wiretap provision after 10 years--and placed few, if any, limits on many of the expanded law enforcement powers in the PATRIOT Act. Unfortunately, the conference report has removed or weakened some of the most important limits on enhanced investigative powers in the Senate bill, particularly those relating to FISA orders for library, medical, and other types of business records about people, National Security Letters, and notification of sneak-and-peek searches. We need to reauthorize the expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act, but we need to do so with procedural safeguards like those in the Senate bill. The Senate is known as the more contemplative body in Congress for a reason, and I think we should take the time we need to truly debate and discuss some important civil liberties issues that the conference report implicates. For this reason, I have cosponsored Senator Sununu's bill, S. 2082, which would extend the expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act until March 31, 2006. I believe that 3 months is enough time for us to come back after the holidays and work out the differences between the House and Senate versions of the PATRIOT Act reauthorization. I would encourage all of my colleagues to do the same.|109432|051216|83|Scr16de05-95 95.txt|1871|1961|S13708-S13735|5944|967|RI|Jack Reed|S|NA|Democratic

Madam Speaker, that is the Democrat Party here in Washington, DC. It was announced in the press in October that they were going to come out with their great agenda in November. November came and went, they had nothing. In January they said, that is going to be the time we are going to lay out our agenda, our positive agenda for America. January came and went. Twice more they set dates to roll out their agenda, but nothing. They got nothing except this nifty little phrase, ``We can do better.'' It is a sad state of affairs when they have no agenda, no ideas. All they have is negative attacks, partisan attacks here in Washington.

10920060004400|Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R 4882, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center Deadline Enforcement Act. I want to thank the chairman of the Committee on Resources, the gentleman from California , and also our ranking member, the gentleman from West Virginia , for their leadership in bringing this legislation to the floor. In 2003, Congress authorized the construction of a visitor center for the Vietnam Memorial to help provide information and educate the public about the memorial and the Vietnam War. Unfortunately, over the past three years, progress in selecting a location for the visitor's center has stalled due to bureaucratic red- tape. The legislation we are considering today will bring the site- selection process to a close by designating both a location for the center's construction and a deadline for its completion. I believe an Educational Visitors Center will serve as an important learning tool for the millions of visitors who visit the Wall each year, especially those too young to remember Vietnam. I strongly support this effort to at last make the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Visitor Center a reality and I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this legislation.|109046|060328|11|Hcr28mr06-127 1.txt|286|306|H1137-H1139|1215|198|CA|Dennis Cardoza|H|18|Democratic

10920060007252|Madam Speaker, the carnage and the bloodshed continue in Iraq. Things are getting worse, not better. April is indeed the cruelest month for 63 American soldiers who won't be making it home. In fact, it is the deadliest month so far in the year 2006. We are coming up on the 3-year anniversary of the President's infamous aircraft carrier flight suit stunt, and I am still looking for someone who can answer this question: How is it possible that we have lost more than 2,000 of our troops after this mission was supposedly accomplished? Today's big headline? The President has a new spokesman. As if the same talking points, the same platitudes, the same wretched ideas coming out of a different mouth is going to make a lick of difference. The White House doesn't have a PR problem, it has a policy problem. Do they actually think two out of every three Americans are unhappy with the President's performance because of his Press Secretary? Are they that dismissive of the intelligence of the people they are sworn to serve? It is as if the administration were our landlord in a house that was being condemned, with a foundation crumbling and every corner infested with vermin, and when we register our complaints, they go ahead and change the drapes. There will be a new talking head at the briefing room podium, but the administration's approach remains stubbornly resistant to change. The other big news of the day is that Secretaries Rice and Rumsfeld dropped in on Iraq, and from this visit we learn that there may be a troop reduction by the end of the year. But that strikes me as a cosmetic, contrived move that is driven by the political calendar. It is clearly not enough. Remember, this President, who says he doesn't believe in timetables, made it perfectly clear that he intends to keep our troops in Iraq for at least as long as he is in office. And there is every reason to believe that the construction of permanent military bases has begun. This is exactly the open-ended, long-term occupation that fuels the rage of the insurgency. I, for one, am not willing to stay silent on the sidelines. I will do everything in my power to make the case that the troops should come home now. I will continue to explore alternatives to our current Iraq policy, and I will continue to shine a spotlight on conditions on the ground in Iraq. To that end I invite my colleagues to join me tomorrow morning as I convene a forum that will help put a human face on the Iraq conflict. We will hear from an impressive panel of witnesses, including: A Georgetown professor, who spent the bulk of his career with the CIA, where he was considered one of the Agency's preeminent counterterrorism experts. We will hear from a Shia Iraqi woman, a civil engineer married to a Sunni, who has lived through the invasion and the occupation and then fled to Jordan after her son was briefly detained as a political prisoner. A marine who served in the Iraq war and was discharged last year due to his post-traumatic stress disorder. A young American doctor, half Iraqi, half Jewish, who recently returned to Iraq, where she lived as a young child. She has put her medical practice on hold to raise awareness about the devastating impact the war is having on the people in Iraq. I will also be joined by several of my colleagues, the gentleman from New York , the gentleman from Maine , the gentleman from Massachusetts , the gentleman from North Carolina , and the gentlewomen from California, Ms. Lee and Ms. Waters, among other Members of the House of Representatives. We will engage in a dialogue with these panelists, and we will offer our own thoughts on Iraq. I had a similar forum last fall, which was focused more on shifting policy direction and brainstorming about how we might carry out a military exit strategy. That will be a component of tomorrow's discussion, but my intent tomorrow is to present firsthand accounts from people who have lived through this war and can speak authoritatively about its human cost. We hear virtually every day from the White House, the civilian leadership at the Pentagon, and the military commanders. I think it is important that we give a platform to those who have stared this war directly in the eye, outside of the Green Zone, without a security detail or an armored limousine. I hope you can join me tomorrow.|109034|060426|4|Hcr26ap06-127 1.txt|23|95|H1820-H1821|4346|767|CA|Lynn Woolsey|H|6|Democratic
10920060007997|Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Michigan for his support of this legislation. I introduced a bipartisan bill in September of 2005 about the same time that my colleague from Michigan did. Our approaches are different in some respects, but this legislation we are voting on today, a slightly different version of which was included in the October 2005 Gas Act that the House has already passed, is a good bill. It is a solid piece of legislation and deserves the support of the House. I also recognize that this is only one piece of the puzzle. We want to give the Federal Trade Commission the authority to investigate possible price gouging. But that is not going to solve all of our energy problems. This focuses on one piece of the problem. The bill that we will consider next on the floor of the House will also look at another piece of the problem, and we are going to try to pass some further legislation that deals with tax codes, that increases domestic supply, that invests in alternative sources, things like E-85. Since we passed the Energy Act in August and the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee came out to New Mexico to sign that landmark piece of legislation, there are 29 new ethanol plants that have requested permits so that we can use corn to fuel our vehicles rather than having to import oil from other countries. Mr. Speaker, this bill includes strong penalties, in fact stronger than the ones that my colleague from Michigan has in his bill. I think maybe if we would have worked together, we could have come up with a good bill that both of our names were on. It gives us good clear definitions and says, we have got 23 States that have price-gouging laws, we need to get a clear Federal definition of price gouging, and the Federal Trade Commission will give that to us. It also deals with every month of the year. The bill that we introduced in September, and my colleague from Michigan's bill as well, only deals with emergencies, when a disaster is declared. I think there is justification for saying the Federal Trade Commission should have authority to look at unfair trade practices, whatever time they may be.|109320|060503|28|Hcr03my06-129 1.txt|693|725|H1993-H1999|2158|384|NM|Heather Wilson|H|1|Republican
10920060008162|Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I will support this amendment. I don't, frankly, know that this has ever been an issue that I have heard of or seen in the press that someone has converted a leadership PAC to personal use. It shouldn't happen and, therefore, I don't have a problem supporting the amendment. To the extent that it is difficult for the FEC to make a judgment call on what is personal use and what is not, this doesn't compound it because they already have to make that judgment when it comes to re- election PACs. I would just note that, like the rest of the bill before us, this is okay, but it really doesn't accomplish the real problem solving that the country is crying out for. I don't think that any of our Members on this side of the aisle oppose, but even approving this will not clean up the ethics swamp that the country is so very concerned about.

There is not a blank checkbook, as some, perhaps some from Massachusetts or other parts, might suggest where it is just an ongoing, empty, bottomless pit of spending. You have to be responsible about the taxpayers' money. You have to draw lines around it and prioritize, and we have done that in this budget. In the minority, you have the luxury of not having to rally behind any one particular proposal. In fact, that is why there are two different substitutes offered that offer at least two very different viewpoints from your own caucus. We have the obligation, we have the responsibility to actually move a product that changes lives. We have the responsibility to actually pass a budget that implements spending controls on an over $2 trillion Federal budget and put us on a path to cutting the deficit while still securing a climate that allows economic growth and prosperity to continue.

10920060012648|Mr. Chairman, this is a very simple issue. We have ongoing litigation in the courts. There are hearings being held. There is discovery being conducted. And most of us who have conservative impulses on both sides of the aisle think the Constitution means something and the separation of powers means something, and the courts ought to finish their process. For the executive branch to come in and take a side in this dispute is disrespectful to the balance of power in the Constitution. There is a dispute that is going on that may have merit on both sides, but let the litigation play itself out. If this can happen in this instance, there is no possible controversy involving the Army Corps of Engineers where there is not a possibility of the executive branch inserting itself in the judicial.

10920060039865|Even though I think using section 920 is the wrong way to go. The Senator indicated he has been informed there is $11 billion in the 920 accounts. I just direct the Senator's attention to page 29 of the concurrent resolution on the budget. If the Senator would direct his attention there and go down the table to allowances, 920, I think the Senator would see there, in fact, is no money in section 920. In fact, section 920 is $500 million in the hole. There is no $11 billion there. That is the problem we have. There is no $11 billion there. Section 920 is actually $500 million underwater. This will just put it further underwater, which will require an across- the-board cut in these other areas: homeland security among them, law enforcement, veterans benefits, defense. Actually, we do not know what the appropriators will do. So I just say that for the information of my colleagues, who may have some sense that there is money in this account, that there really is not.

10920060049563|Mr. President, I rise to speak against the bill. I want to begin by saying that America has a proud history of immigration. When we say that America is a nation of immigrants, we mean that deep in our national consciousness is the image of America as a haven and a place of opportunity for people from all over the world. Our policies have reflected that image. America has always had more open immigration policies than any other country. But those policies have been the result of choices the American people have made. We are a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. Like all sovereign nations, America has the right to determine who may enter our country and who may not. The American people have chosen to strike a legal balance between their desire to provide opportunities to new residents of diverse backgrounds and the economic reality that too much immigration too fast will depress the wages and diminish the hopes of millions of our own citizens. I say with the utmost respect that the bill before us completely abandons that traditional balance. It provides an amnesty to those who, however understandable their motives, have chosen to trespass on our hospitality and violate our laws and does so under conditions that history has shown will increase rather than decrease illegal immigration in the future. It allows a vast new immigration for decades to come, with no regard whatsoever for the impact on the lives and hopes of our own citizens who have the first claim to the American dream, and it does little or nothing to repair the existing system of legal immigration which regularly confounds the expectations of millions around the world who claim a legal right to enter the United States. Moreover, the Senate has regrettably and inexplicably rejected commonsense amendments which were designed to restore the balance Americans want and have the right to expect. For those reasons, I could not support voting to end debate on the bill, and I will not now support its final passage. I should say at the outset that I do support the border security provisions in the bill. Border security is a national security issue rather than an immigration issue. For that reason, I recently sponsored bipartisan legislation, the Border Security and Modernization Act, in order to help secure America's border with additional manpower, new barriers, and high-tech surveillance equipment. The bill I cosponsored authorizes new funds for technology to assist our Border Patrol, to construct roads, fences, and barriers along the border and to purchase air assets such as helicopters. In addition, the Border Security and Modernization Act will increase resources for border detention centers and enact stricter criminal penalties for human smuggling, falsifying work entry documents, and drug trafficking. The immigration bill before the Senate contains many provisions similar to those in the bill which I cosponsored, and I am pleased the Senate approved an amendment which I also cosponsored to strengthen those provisions providing for the construction of at least 370 miles of triple-layered fence and 500 miles of vehicle barriers at strategic locations along the southwest border. But the good done in the immigration bill by these provisions could largely be accomplished by the President without new statutory authorization and is, in any case, far outweighed by the negatives in the bill. I oppose the bill first because it grants a broad-based amnesty--the right to legal residence and even citizenship--to 10 to 12 million people who violated our laws. Permanent residence in the United States, not to mention American citizenship, is a valuable and important privilege. Granting these privileges under these circumstances rewards and therefore encourages unlawful immigration. It demoralizes and punishes the millions of people around the world who have respected our rules and who are trying patiently to immigrate legally into the United States, and it makes a mockery of the policy that is supposed to form our immigration laws--the desire to balance our need for workers and vision of America as a place of opportunity against the importance of protecting jobs and wages at home. If Congress grants an amnesty under these circumstances, what will be the argument against granting another amnesty 5, 10, or 20 years from now if millions more people, in response to the incentives created by this bill, manage to enter the United States illegally? To those who say this will not happen, I say that it has already happened. Congress granted an amnesty 20 years ago for largely the same reasons under the same conditions and with the same assurances being offered in support of this bill before us today. Far from preventing illegal immigration, that amnesty has magnified the problem by four- or fivefold. What reason do we have to believe the same thing will not happen if we pass this bill, especially since the amnesty procedure in this bill is certain and takes effect immediately, while the border security provisions may not work at all and will, in any event, take years to implement? I suspect the pressure on our borders is increasing even now simply because the Senate is seriously debating an amnesty. I also oppose the bill because it authorizes a vast and unvalidated increase in immigration. The bill allows 70 to 90 million immigrants to enter the country over the next 20 years--not, by and large, scientists, doctors, or engineers, but people who will compete directly against Americans for jobs in the hospitality industry or for craft work in construction or manufacturing. I begrudge no one the desire to come to the United States to make a better life for themselves. My grandparents did that, and so did my wife's mother. I certainly hope the economy will grow fast enough that we will need additional workers, but our first responsibility is to our own people. We cannot sustain the American dream if we do not provide opportunity for all Americans, including those who do not or cannot go to college. I can think of nothing more likely to cause conflict and division, and raise the ugly specter of ethnic prejudice than making millions of Americans compete against foreign workers, sometimes in economic recessions, for the jobs their families need to make ends meet. Congress should be willing to increase legal immigration where our employers have proven needs that our own workers cannot meet. I believe such shortage exists today in certain parts of the economy, such as agriculture, and I would be willing to consider increases in the current limits in those areas. But that decision should be made on the basis of evidence, not speculation, and Congress should make it carefully and for short periods of time rather than guessing what the labor situation will be 10 or 20 years from now. These decisions we are considering today matter. They affect the lives of millions of our people who rightly expect that we will look out for their interests, not make them feel guilty about their legitimate concerns for themselves and their loved ones. Moreover, the legal immigration provisions in the bill will cost our taxpayers $54 billion over the next 10 years. That fact is not disputed, even by the sponsors of the bill. Because of the deficit, our health care programs are under pressure. Congress is begrudging disaster relief to our farmers. The Nation's transportation infrastructure is underfunded, and some are proposing to reduce the defense budget or increase taxes. I simply cannot understand why, at a time like this, Congress would undertake an additional budgetary commitment of this magnitude to foreign workers our economy may not even need. Finally, I oppose the bill because it does very little to fix the current legal immigration system. The great irony of this whole debate is that it has focused largely on the wrong problem. If we want to help the economy and provide justice to immigrants, we should concentrate first on making our current programs at least minimally workable. As Senators are probably aware, there are significant backlogs in our current system due to the sheer volume of aliens eligible to legally immigrate to the United States. As of December 31, 2003, the U.S. Customs and Immigration Service, that is the USCIS, reported 5.3 million immigrant petitions pending. USCIS decreased the number of immigrant petitions by 24 percent by the end of fiscal year 2004--that is a pretty good job--but they still had 4.1 million petitions pending. Every new applicant who is not an immediate relative of a U.S. citizen must go to the end of lines that vary in length according to country, the prospective immigrant's relationship to their American sponsor, and profession. According to the State Department, experienced laborers from India face a 5-year wait for a visa, while Filipino siblings of Americans wait more than 22 years. In my office, we live with this problem with the current immigration system every day. I have five caseworkers who spend parts of each day in response to constituent requests, assisting those who actually claim a legal right to enter our country. These prospective immigrants have respected our laws. They and their Missouri sponsors spend large amounts of time and money trying to navigate the existing system. We have almost 200 pending cases in our office alone. They include Missourians who want to adopt children from abroad, foreign doctors who want to work in rural areas where they are desperately needed, and world renowned researchers who want to bring their knowledge to the United States. These people have a right to immigrate under the current laws. Yet the bill does nothing for them. In fact, the bill makes their situation worse because it puts them at the back of the line. The bill inevitably means that the time and attention of the Immigration Service will be spent processing the applications of undocumented workers and administering a vague new guest worker program for 70 million to 90 million people, rather than on the cases of legal immigrants which, in some cases, have been pending for years. What I have just said is the answer to those who claim this bill is necessary because it is the only practical solution to our current situation. Mr. President, anybody even marginally familiar with our current legal immigration system knows that it is in disarray. I honor the work of our border agents, but the reality is that our existing border security system is in every respect inadequate. I recognize that many diligent government workers are trying to process the claims of legal immigrants, but here again, they and the system are overwhelmed, even in trying to administer the current complicated visa system. The idea that our current immigration infrastructure can take on the real job of border security, process a multitiered amnesty program for 10 million to 12 million illegal aliens, and administer the claims of 70 million to 90 million new immigrants, in addition to its current responsibilities, is sheer fantasy. And to argue in favor of this bill on the grounds that it is a practical solution to anything shows how far from reality the proponents of this legislation have really traveled. Mr. President, I suppose there are many in Missouri who support this bill, and I know many Senators have worked hard to come up with this legislation. But in the last month, I have received over 4,000 calls, e-mails, and letters urgently in opposition to this measure before us, and I think a word should be spoken on behalf of the concerns of those constituents. They are not paranoid because, in a world of terrorism, they want the border under control. They are not ungenerous because they worry about jobs for themselves and their children. And they are not less progressive than Washington opinionmakers because they believe in the sovereign right of a democratic people who decide who and who shouldn't become a resident of this country. The Senate had a chance to pass a good bill, a bill that secured the border, that fixed the system of legal immigration, that developed the biometrics our border security and immigration agents need to enforce the law that stops the coyotes and the fly-by-night employers from circumventing the law and paying cash to unlawful workers. The Senate has fumbled that chance. I suppose this bill will pass, based on the votes we have had in the last week or so. My hope is that in conference with the House, the Senate will agree to a commonsense bill that I can support, one that respects the balance which the American people want, are waiting for, and have the right to expect. Mr. President, I yield the floor.|109285|060524|1|Scr24my06-169 1.txt|16|212|S5107-S5108|12718|2118|MO|Jim Talent|S|NA|Republican

10920060053508|Mr. President, the Senate's debate on U.S policy with respect to the war in Iraq has been healthy. There is no question but that every Member of this Chamber is deeply proud of America's men and women in uniform and the magnificent job they have done and continue to do to bring peace and stability to that troubled land. Like all my colleagues, I want them all to come home to their loved ones and this grateful Nation as soon as possible. But our departure from Iraq must not leave a greater risk of terror taking hold there. We cannot afford to leave Iraq in a condition that terrorists could take over the country, as they did in Afghanistan before September 11. I have given the views of my colleagues on all sides of today's votes careful consideration. I have concluded that I cannot support any policy that would set an arbitrary timeline for the start, rate, or conclusion of the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq. The decision to drawdown American forces must be based on the application of our military commanders' professional judgment assessing actual security conditions on the ground. Withdrawal of U.S. forces must be based on the objective criteria of local stability and the capability of Iraqi forces. Setting a timeline for withdrawal limits our Commander in Chief's strategic options and denies our local commanders the operational flexibility necessary to sustain progress to stability and reduce the risks of the insurgency taking any tactical advantage. We all pray for the safe return of every one of our men and women in uniform, as soon as the mission of leaving Iraq in the hands of a stable government can be accomplished.|109130|060622|12|Scr22jn06-86 1.txt|333|359|S6324-S6401|1653|284|FL|Bill Nelson|S|NA|Democratic

10920060063827|Mr. President, there are some things so ironic around here that you just have to smile. We are just coming off this election--and I congratulate my colleagues on the other side for their success with a significant and dramatic win. But if we listen to the rhetoric from them, and certainly from the pundits who analyzed the election, it was obviously about the war in Iraq, but it was also about fiscal discipline. I don't know how many times I have read from national pundits, from the Washington Post and the New York Times, how the Democratic Party is now the party of fiscal discipline. Yet the first amendment brought to the floor of this Senate--the first amendment--increases the national debt by $4.9 billion. It exceeds the budget by $4.9 billion and claims it is an emergency, on an issue which has already been addressed by this Senate, I think, two, maybe three times, and rejected. Well, maybe the folks out there who voted and thought they were voting for fiscal discipline when they voted to bring in the other party should take a look at this amendment and ask: Where did this come from? Is this a bill of goods I just got sold? The first amendment brought up by the other side of the aisle after they win this significant, important, dramatic victory is to ask for $4.9 billion above the budget, throw it on the debt, increase spending. It is, as I said, ironic. It makes you wonder. I wonder where we are headed under this new regime. There is something called a regular appropriations process. In fact, it is very likely that we will get to an agriculture bill, an appropriations bill before we adjourn this session, euphemistically referred to as a lameduck session. When that bill comes up, if it is the belief, contention, and argument of those in the farm communities who have been affected by what they feel is a bad crop-year--if they believe they need additional funds, that bill will have the opportunity to shift funds around, move funds to those accounts that are needed, and which need additional funding, within the context of the budget, within the limitations of the budget. That is called regular order. But this is not regular order. This is a daytime robbery of the Treasury, a heist, in open daylight, and I give them credit for that. There is nothing secretive about this. This is just saying we have the votes, so we are going to come to the floor and spend $4.9 billion and add it to the Federal debt and call it an emergency. It is going to stuff the budget. It is not good policy. It is not good fiscal policy. It clearly, in my humble opinion--I may have misread the election. I wasn't up for reelection, but I have certainly read a lot about it, and I participated on the stump enough. I think it sells the people of this country who voted in the election a bill of goods they didn't think they were buying--in fact, just the opposite. I understand there are some folks on my side of the aisle who also feel compelled to vote for this amendment. I regret that, too, obviously. I hope they will reconsider. In any event, it is an amendment that violates the budget. It is, therefore, subject to a 60- vote point of order. We have 60-vote points of order here in order to try to maintain some semblance of fiscal discipline. This will be our first exercise in trying to maintain that semblance of fiscal discipline in what you might call the new congressional year. It will be a good test for us as a Senate for my colleagues on the other side who are about to become the majority party, and for us on this side, who will become the honorable minority. It will be a good test for us to see if we have the courage to actually initiate fiscal discipline in this new Congress. The opportunity is there. All we need is 41 votes. Mr. President, 59 people can vote for their constituencies, vote to raise spending, raise the debt, vote to increase spending outside the budget. It will be a good test to see whether there are 41 people here who took the message away from the election that the pundits have told us is the message, that the national Democratic Party told us is the message, and that some of our own folks on our side told us is the message, which is that they expect the Congress to start living within its budgets. It will be a good test of whether at least the working minority heard that message. At this point, I will make a point of order. Mr. President, pursuant to the fiscal year 2006 budget resolution, I raise a point of order against the emergency designation in the pending amendment.|109303|061114|31|Scr14no06-128 1.txt|664|733|S10889-S10908|4547|827|NH|Judd Gregg|S|NA|Republican

10920060066102|Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about the pending passage of the Native American Methamphetamine Enforcement and Treatment Act of 2006. Section 2 of the act authorizes Indian tribes to receive grants under section 2996 of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act in order to address the scourge of methamphetamine. I strongly support aiding Indian tribes in their efforts to combat the methamphetamine epidemic in Indian country. Members of the steering committee, which I chair, expressed concern about one part of the original bill--a concern that I am pleased to announce will be addressed by the substitute amendment. Part of the bill authorizes tribes to receive grants, under 42 U.S.C. 3793cc, to ``investigate, arrest and prosecute individuals violating laws related to the use, manufacture, or sale of methamphetamine.'' The problem was that the bill originally appeared to authorize any tribe, without limitation, to receive these grants-- grants that can only be used for law enforcement activities. Permitting these grants to all tribes would not have been appropriate, since many tribes--indeed, perhaps a majority of the officially recognized tribes in this country--do not have any criminal jurisdiction. Many officially recognized tribes, for example, were only recognized long after their States were admitted to the Union or only received land from the Federal government long after that land had become part of a State and State jurisdiction had attached to it. Although these tribes may receive Federal services, their recognition or receipt of land did not divest the State of its jurisdiction or bring into being a new government within the State. Nearly half of the recognized tribes in the United States, for example, are in the State of Alaska, and were first recognized in the early 1990s. Obviously, the Federal Government did not create over 200 new governments in Alaska by this action. Tribes such as these do not exercise any governmental powers and, consequently, do not have the authority to arrest, prosecute, or punish individuals. In several other States, although tribes were preserved as separate jurisdictions when their surrounding States entered the Union, and they enjoyed criminal law enforcement powers for many years thereafter, those tribes were later divested of criminal jurisdiction by Public Law 280. That law transferred criminal jurisdiction from tribes to State and local governments in the several States identified in that law or that later opted into its provisions. Again, because tribes in Public Law 280 States no longer have criminal jurisdiction, they cannot arrest, prosecute, or punish individuals for crimes. Arguably, the Justice Department would have been aware of these issues and would have only awarded grants to tribes that exercise criminal jurisdiction. These issues, however, are more in the expertise of the Department of the Interior than the Justice Department, and there have been reports that some law enforcement grants were inappropriately awarded to nongovernmental tribes in the 1990s. The language added by new paragraph 2 of the act serves as a reminder to the Justice Department to first verify that a tribe exercises law enforcement powers before awarding a grant to the tribe under paragraph 3793cc. When a tribe applies for such a grant, the Department must first determine whether the tribe exercise law enforcement powers. It must ask, was the tribe preserved as a separate jurisdiction when its surrounding State was admitted to the Union, and is the tribe subject to Public Law 280? Only if the answer to the first question is yes and the second is no is the tribe eligible to receive grants under paragraph 3793cc.   &lt;bullet&gt; Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today the Senate is acting on H.R. 798 Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act, with an amendment developed by the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith. This legislation is designed to assist communities perform preliminary site assessments and remediate former methamphetamine, or meth, labs. The bill requires the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, to develop voluntary guidelines for communities engaged in meth remediation activities. The guidelines would help communities identify contaminants from meth labs and establish appropriate cleanup levels. In implementing this legislation, it is my hope that the EPA should also issue companion regulations that would assist communities in implementing these voluntary guidelines. These regulations should identify contaminants from meth labs, establish appropriate cleanup levels, address sampling activities in the residences, training and certification for response workers, and use of personal protective equipment. There is a need for regulations and a Federal cleanup standard, in addition to voluntary guidelines, because of the nature and abundance of waste produced from meth labs. Many of the chemicals and wastes often associated with meth production are considered hazardous wastes under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA. Some of these wastes are classified under RCRA as ``characteristic'' waste, meaning that they are ignitable. Other wastes produced by the manufacture of meth are regulated in other sections of law, such as the solvents and other chemicals used in the purification process. The reason companion regulation is needed is meth's toxicity. One pound of manufactured meth produces 5 pounds of waste. Chemicals used in meth production cause breathing problems, skin irritation, headaches, damage to the central nervous system, and, in some cases, death. Meth waste is typically dumped on the ground or down drains, which contaminates drain fields, soils and surface waters. Cleanup usually involves the removal and disposal of wastes and the ventilation and plumbing systems. Several States have already developed standards and regulations for cleanup and for determining if a meth-contaminated property is ``clean.'' Oregon's level is 0.5 micrograms per square foot. And the State of Tennessee has set a level that is 0.1 microgram per hundred square centimeters. EPA should follow suit. Ten years ago, EPA developed extensive regulations for the remediation of lead based paint waste. Waste from meth labs appears to present a more immediate public safety concern. EPA should develop the same type of comprehensive regulations to address sampling and worker protection, and should do all it can to assist our communities in these efforts.&lt;bullet&gt;|109009|061208|3|Scr08de06pt2-306 1.txt|27|128|S11802-S11803|6525|1003|AL|Jeff Sessions|S|NA|Republican

11020070001741|Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, on June 21, 2004, Space Ship One became the first privately funded craft to take a person into space. Space Ship One flew again on September 29, 2004, and on October 4, 2004, and upon successful completion of these flights, Mojave Aerospace Ventures, the developers of Space Ship One, captured the $10 million Ansari X PRIZE. Just as important as Space Ship One's historic flights, the competition for the X PRIZE spurred the creation of a private spaceflight industry in this country. It is with this past success in mind that I rise to speak in support of the new Automotive X PRIZE. This new prize will award a multimillion-dollar prize to teams that can design, build and demonstrate production-capable vehicles that achieve 100 miles per gallon or its equivalent. With the current price of oil hovering around $100 per barrel, it is more important than ever that our country develops technologies that increase the efficiencies of our automobiles. To this end, I was pleased to support H.R. 6, which significantly raised CAFE standards, and would do much to increase the efficiency of American automobiles. However, the government does not hold a monopoly on innovation. Many of the great discoveries of our time were accomplished by private individuals and companies. From Thomas Edison's discovery of the light bulb to Henry Ford's perfection of the automobile, private innovators have changed the face of America. It is my hope that the Automotive X PRIZE will once again spur the creative and innovative spirit of American citizens to help us in our fight for energy independence and security. I would like to thank Mr. Lungren for introducing this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

11020070013596|These are input costs. You know the diesel price has doubled. I mean, my farmers, when they plant the corn, they're in a tractor. When they harvest the corn or the beans, they're in a tractor. It's run by diesel fuel. There's an attack on ethanol today. I was in committee today, I mean, 2 days ago, let's stop the RFS. It's the only thing that we have. And why is it under attack? Because input cost to production of commodity grain has gone up because we can't get low price diesel fuel. When we harvest the corn we take it to a grain elevator. We do that with a big diesel truck, a big tractor trailer. We have independent truckers striking. They drove around here a couple of weeks ago, big signs. We can't afford the high cost of diesel. And we know costs get passed on. What's some Democrats' response? Oh, we've got a great idea. Let's tax the energy companies more. My challenge is, when have we ever raised a tax that's lowered the price to a consumer? And I've challenged people; give me one example where we raised the tax and costs went down. No one's challenged me. And I'm sure people will look at that. Another thing is let's demand that the people we're reliant on, pump more crude oil. Oh, that helps us not become reliant on imported cried oil. Let's demand that the people who are providing us oil pump more. That's why I'm so frustrated with this. I hope you understand.

11020070014221|Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes I rise today in support of the farm bill conference report. I thank the chairman and all of the other members of the Agriculture Committee on both sides of the aisle for working in such a bipartisan spirit to produce good legislation. I also thank my staff and the majority staff for their hard and, I know to them, seemingly endless work on this legislation. This farm bill contains solid reforms while addressing a variety of issues including forestry, rural development, renewable energy, nutrition, conservation, research, specialty crops, and livestock and still maintains the safety net necessary to ensure a safe, reliable and affordable domestic food supply. This farm bill is a good work product, and I am proud of the work we have done. The bill contains more reforms than any previous farm bill, eliminating payments to millionaire farmers, eliminating the three- entity rule, and increasing the efficiency of the crop insurance program among numerous other reforms. It's 100 percent PAYGO-compliant and is fiscally responsible, scoring $4 billion less than the House bill and $5 billion less than the Senate bill. I think you would be hard-pressed, Mr. Speaker, to find a conference report in the history of this body that came back scoring less than the House and Senate bills. That is a significant achievement, and I think it would be foolish to overlook the positive changes this farm bill has undergone. When we talk about the farm bill, many believe that the Congress is voting on a $288 billion bill that goes directly to farmers. The truth is that only 17 percent of the farm bill spending is devoted to farm programs, while nearly 70 percent goes to the nutrition title alone. In fact, there is very little farm in a farm bill anymore. In 2002, the farm program funding comprised just three-quarters of 1 percent of the Federal budget. Today, farm program funding accounts for just one-quarter of 1 percent of the Federal budget, a twofold reduction in just 5 years. Agriculture policy is essential to the lives of every American, and it is important that the policy we formulate is responsible, effective and at a low cost to the taxpayer.|110354|070328|124|Hcr28mr07-153 1.txt|3097|3212|NONE|7226|1289|SC|John M.

11020070017956|Mr. Speaker, my district is home to many beautiful American treasures and one of them is the Chesapeake Bay. ``Save the Bay'' is one message that reaches beyond all political boundaries. Working alongside my longtime colleague and friend Jo Anne Davis in the 109th Congress, we passed legislation to create the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail--which is part of the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network we are reauthorizing today. As many of you know, this initiative falls under the larger Chesapeake Bay Program, which was created in 1983 to restore and protect the bay. I am proud to lend my vote in favor of this bill today, however, I would like to call attention to one of the greater matters that this Congress should also be voting on: legislation to help the American people pay for the astounding cost of energy. One example is a comprehensive bill by Representative Peterson that creates a partnership between energy development and the environment. This bill opens up the OCS for natural gas exploration and uses an estimated $86 billion dollars in royalties for environmental restoration efforts. The Chesapeake Bay Commission estimated that the total cost to restore the Chesapeake Bay is $19 billion. The NEED Act fully funds the Chesapeake Bay restoration effort at $20 billion. This energy bill is another way we can help Save the Bay, and the budgets of American families. I am an original cosponsor of the NEED Act and I believe it is an example of bipartisan energy legislation. We must all come together in a bipartisan manner to pass legislation that will increase our domestic energy supply and help alleviate soaring prices. I cannot speak for your districts, but families in Virginia's Second District need an energy solution now and it is our job to give them one.|110900|070501|1|Hcr01my07-151 1.txt|10|12|NONE|115|18|NA|Speaker|NA|NA|N/A
11020070018939|Can you imagine that the human rights and dignity of those who are already brutalized through a horrific tragedy of catastrophic proportions are now denied their human dignity because this oppressive regime in Burma refuses to allow the international aid organizations to go forward? I hope by our reemphasizing this declaration, that we will stand in abhorrence, in outrage over such undignified treatment. And then I would ask, as we move forward, that we can no longer tolerate the genocide in Sudan, and the completely reckless response of the Sudanese Government in Khartoum to the dignity and human rights of those in Darfur. We have a litany of those. Those Tibetans who continue to fight every day in Tibet simply to be acknowledged, simply to allow the Dalai Lama to return over religion reasons. And to think that he has to be denied the right to come back over religion reasons, Mr. Speaker. They allow him to come on political reasons, on government affirmation, on saluting the government, but just to be able to engage in his religious, if you will, explanation, he is denied his human rights, the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world. We could give a roll call along the way of the travesties of justice. Might I compliment and announce the change-around in Liberia with President Johnson, who recognized a nation that had literally burned the principles of human dignity and human rights; now, with her stellar leadership, she is restoring the dignity to the Liberian people. It can be done. It can be done in Sudan. It can be done in Bangladesh. It can be done in Burma. It can be done in North Vietnam. It can be done in places where oppression exists.

11020070029617|Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this conference agreement. This is the first time in ten years that we will reauthorize the Higher Education Act, landmark legislation that has strengthened our colleges and universities and made the dream of higher education possible for countless Americans. I commend the bipartisan, bicameral work of Education and Labor Chairman George Miller and Ranking Member Buck McKeon, and Senators Kennedy, Mikulski and Enzi who crafted this compromise, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of it. Our Nation's competitiveness depends on a vigorous college and university system and on ample opportunities for Americans to pursue their educational goals. As the first member of my family to graduate from college, I know firsthand that affordable access to higher education is the key to the American Dream for working families. H.R. 4137 is an important step to make sure our schools remain strong and that students from all walks of life can go to college. H.R. 4137 keeps costs down for students and provides additional support through Pell Grants and education loans. It strengthens successful college-readiness initiatives and bolsters cooperation between school districts and teacher-preparation faculties. It improves access to emergency notification services for students. And it makes the process of applying to and planning for school easier: streamlining the federal student financial aid application; creating the ``College Navigator'' to provide cost and aid data to prospective students; and ensuring professors and students know the costs of course textbooks before the semester starts. I am pleased that this bill includes support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities in my district and across North Carolina, recognizing schools that have added master's degree programs with a new source of grant funding. It also provides new funding for Predominately Black Institutions. These schools, which include Fayetteville State University, Shaw University and North Carolina Wesleyan in my Congressional district, have an important ongoing role in improving educational opportunities for African Americans. I am also pleased that the conference agreement recognizes the situation of military families, like so many families of soldiers at North Carolina's Fort Bragg, who move frequently or are deployed abroad. H.R. 4137 requires states to offer in-state tuition rates to soldiers and their dependents when the soldier is deployed for more than 30 days. We must not allow service to our country to prevent the education of a soldier or his or her family. Mr. Speaker, education is the key to better lives and a brighter future for individuals and our Nation. H.R. 4137 improves educational opportunities for all Americans.

11020070032859|Mr. Chairman, I rise today in full support of passage of H.R. 3036, the No Child Left Inside Act. I worked with Chairman Miller and Mr. Sarbanes, the sponsor of the bill and a member of my subcommittee which has jurisdiction over environmental education. It is a pleasure to support the professional development of environmental educators and expand the capacity of these teachers and the States in which they work to bring environmental education to our Nation's young people through this bill. The No Child Left Inside Act seeks to improve the professional development opportunities of our Nation's environmental educators. We know that teachers make the difference in the educational experience of young people and their educational outcomes. By creating professional development opportunities that are meaningful and relevant for our teachers, they in turn will make environmental education meaningful and relevant for their students. These students evolve into the voting citizens who will craft our Nation's future. The bill contributes to ensuring a scientifically literate society through ensuring a more scientifically literate teaching force. The National Academies of Science recently released a report titled ``Public Participation in Environmental Assessment and Decision Making.'' The first conclusion states that ``When done well, public participation improves the quality and legitimacy of a decision and builds the capacity of all involved to engage in the policy process. It can lead to better results in terms of environmental quality and other social objectives. It also can enhance trust and understanding among parties. Achieving these results depends on using practices that address difficulties that specific aspects of the context can present.'' This is a description of democracy at work. It is important to ensure that our society is scientifically literate and therefore capable of not only understanding, but critically assessing, scientific data and weighing the societal consequences of these decisions. Science education is critical for the future of our Nation. So many of the skills taught and utilized in science are used and necessary for success in the global knowledge economy. We know that students learn so much and may even be more inspired when presented with opportunities outside the classroom and programs like these are often what sparks a student's interest in science. H.R. 3036 has a role here. Beyond professional development, the bill contains a grant program to make environmental education more effective and more widely practiced. These grants will have local, regional, and national impact, and will increase the number of young people who understand the importance of the environment and our interaction with it. To keep American competitive and number one, we must have a scientifically literate society, and H.R. 3036 works to ensure this. I ask my colleagues to join me in a yes vote on this bill.|110313|070712|19|Hcr12jy07-94 1.txt|636|637|NONE|102|20|OH|Betty Sutton|H|13|Democratic
11020070034059|Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The night of November 9 through November 10 of the year 1938 consisted of hours of darkness that the world cannot afford to forget. Known as Kristallnacht, that horrible night of unleashed terror and violence that we remember in this resolution before us today, was the clear signal for the start of Adolf Hitler's orchestrated campaign of genocide. On that night, as state-sponsored violence poured out into the streets, the halls of civilized governments were mute. Joseph Goebbels had announced in his speech on the day of November 8, and I quote, ``The Fuhrer has decided that . . . demonstrations should not be prepared or organized by the Party, but insofar as they erupt spontaneously, they are not to be hampered.'' Following that speech, regional leaders of Hitler's National Socialist Party issued instructions to their local offices, and violence erupted across Germany and in some neighboring countries as well, in a matter that was anything but spontaneous. For 48 terrible hours, mobs rampaged through the streets of German, Czechoslovak and Austrian cities. The riots destroyed 267 synagogues, shattered an estimated 7,500 windows of Jewish-owned businesses and desecrated many Jewish cemeteries. The Night of Broken Glass claimed the lives of at least 91 Jewish citizens. Unfortunately, the rest of the world remained largely silent when confronted with the news of this organized brutality. We can only wonder how history might have changed, how the war and the genocide of the subsequent years might have been avoided if silence had been replaced by condemnation and strong action. As we look back at the events of that terrible night, from the perspective of the passage of 70 years, we recall what our president at that time, Franklin Roosevelt, said. ``I, myself, could scarcely believe that such things could occur in a 20th century civilization.'' As we consider this resolution, which notes this terrible event 70 years ago and the subsequent organized murder of more than 6 million Jews across Europe during World War II, we realize how important it is that we remember the lessons of the 20th century today at the start of the 21st century. I urge strong adoption of this important resolution, and I reserve the balance of our time.|110014|070718|343|Hcr18jy07-50 1.txt|11707|11726|NONE|1292|231|AZ|Jeff Flake|H|6|Republican

11020070052793|Mr. President, I sought recognition to discuss a number of amendments which I will be proposing to offer. I intend to offer an amendment on emission caps because of my concern that the emission caps which are set in the Lieberman-Warner bill cannot be obtained. I believe the problem of global warming is a major problem and we ought to deal with it, but I think we have to deal with it within the realistic bounds as to what the technology would permit, and it is going to be very difficult to get 60 votes to oppose cloture, and if a legislative proposal is on the floor which is unattainable, we are going to end up getting nothing. So it is my intention to take the emission caps from the Bingaman-Specter bill and offer them as an amendment to the Lieberman-Warner bill. I intend to offer a second amendment--a cost-containment safety-valve amendment. This amendment will include the so-called technology accelerator mechanism which has been included in the Bingaman-Specter bill, and will provide a very important safeguard on the legislation. I intend to offer a third amendment on international competitiveness. It is vital that we not structure legislation which will put United States industry at a substantial disadvantage. On February 14, I testified before the Senate Finance Committee on this subject, noting that China wishes to have 30 years, and by that time there will be no steel industry. So there have to be restrictions on steel illustratively coming in the United States, and this amendment on international competitiveness will deal with that subject. I intend further to offer an amendment captioned ``Process Gas Emissions,'' because there is no technological alternative to a company's annual requirement to submit emissions allowances. Finally, there is a potential fifth amendment, which I am not yet certain about, and that would involve the pathway to the future for coal amendment. The statement was made earlier in the past half hour about Senators not understanding this bill. I think that is a real problem. This is an extraordinarily complex bill. We have had the Warner-Lieberman bill, then we have had the Boxer bill, a second bill, and now I understand there is going to be a third substitute. So as we are working through the amendments which I have articulated, it is a difficult matter, with the topography changing and with the underlying bill changing, and it is my hope this bill will remain on the floor with procedures to give Senators sufficient time to take up the very important matters which are at hand. The first and most fundamental one is to have enough debate so that there is an understanding of the bill. I agree with my distinguished colleague from Virginia, Senator Warner, who a few moments ago asked for time so there could be debate and an exchange. Too often speeches are made on this floor without an opportunity for debate and questioning and cross-questioning to get to the very important matters. There has been some speculation that the procedure that will be employed by the majority leader--so-called filling the tree--would preclude further amendments. I hope that will not be done here. Regrettably, it has become a commonplace practice, going back with Republican majority leaders and Democratic majority leaders, so that the filling of the tree has made a very fundamental change in Senate procedure, which traditionally has been that a Senator could offer an amendment on any subject at any time and get a vote. When the tree is filled, obviously matters cannot be debated and efforts for cloture cannot move forward. This is a matter which has awaited a fair amount of time. It is complex. And if Senators are not able to offer amendments, such as the amendments which I am proposing to offer, there is no way to find out what the merits of the bill are and what the merits of the amendments are. On the subject of filling the tree, I have had for months now an amendment on a rules change filed with the rules committee which would alter the authority of the majority leader to employ the so-called procedure of filling the tree. Another concern which is related has been the shift in the practice of the Senate on the filibusters. There had been a tradition in the Senate that when somebody offered a bill, and there was opposition and the opposition intended to conduct a filibuster--that is to deny a vote unless 60 votes were obtained to cut off debate--that there would be that kind of debate. Most recently, we have seen the practice employed that if someone says there is an intent to have a filibuster, there is a motion to proceed for cloture on a filibuster, there is a 20-minute vote, and when cloture is not invoked, the matter is eliminated. Recently, we had a very serious piece of legislation coming to the floor which sought to change a ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States on the rights of women to obtain relief, where the Supreme Court had imposed a 6-month statute of limitations in a situation where the woman who sought relief didn't even know she had a cause of action within the 6 months. Well, that matter came and went so fast on the Senate floor that nobody knew what it was about. Had the proponents of that legislation debated it, brought it to public attention, and had the opponents of the legislation, who wanted to filibuster it, engaged in extended debate, the public would have understood what was going on. So the matter of having adequate time to debate this very complex legislation is very important. And if there is to be any possibility of finding 60 Senators to coalesce around a cloture petition, 60 Senators to agree on legislation, Senators are going to have to have an opportunity to offer their amendments. There is great therapy in being able to offer an amendment, even if it is not accepted. But we can hardly engage in a practice of filling the tree, where Senators are not permitted to offer amendments, and expect to have this bill move forward, people understand it, and find 60 Senators who are willing to come together on the very important piece of legislation which is at hand. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be included in the Record at this time a summary of the sheet of the five potential amendments I intend to offer, and an explanation of the amendment on the cost-containment safety valve, an explanation on the amendment on international competition, an explanation on the amendment on process gas emissions, and the single sheet which explains the proposal on a possible pathway to the future for the expanded use of coal amendment. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: 2012--cap at 2005 level................... 2012--cap at 2012 level. 2020--15% below 2005 ........ 2020--cap at 2006 level. 2030--30% below 2005...................... 2030--cap at 1990 level. 2050--70% below 2005...................... 2050--60% below 2006|110900|071106|1|Hcr06no07-141 1.txt|6|8|NONE|165|31|NA|Speaker|NA|NA|N/A

11020070070854|Mr. President, yesterday I filed amendment No. 740, which allows dairy farmers in Pennsylvania to receive a one-time emergency assistance payment of $2.50 for every hundredweight of milk they produced over the past 6 months. Because the Senate invoked cloture on this spending bill and we are quickly wrapping up our work to get funding to our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, I will not have the opportunity to offer my amendment today. I will, however, continue to pursue this critical emergency funding for our dairy farmers. Dairy farmers in my home State and other Northeastern States are at the end of their rope. They have cut corners and pared their operations down to the absolute necessities, but they simply cannot make ends meet. Prices for feed and fuel have more than doubled over the past year and a half, but the price farmers get for their milk has not kept pace. Consequently, dairy farmers in Pennsylvania are losing about $5 on every hundredweight of milk they produce. For a small dairy farmer with 75 or so cows, this could mean a loss of around $20,000 year. During the last congressional recess, I toured two dairy farms in different regions of Pennsylvania and talked to dozens of farmers. I heard stories about draining savings accounts, trying to patch repair broken equipment, leaving bills unpaid, and selling cows just to keep the farm going. Our farmers are doing everything in their power to keep their businesses going. Unfortunately, many of them are now faced with their last option--to sell everything and shut down the farm. I want to be sure colleagues understand that this is happening right now, today. The prospect of mass closings of dairy farms is not something off in the distant future. Pennsylvania is losing 250 to 350 dairy farms every year. Today, dairy farmers in my home State are sitting down with their families and making tough decisions about the future of their farms. Many of them won't be able to stay in business while they wait for Congress to finish work on the new farm bill. The result would be devastating. Dairy is Pennsylvania's top agricultural commodity, contributing $4.2 billion annually to the State economy and employing 40,000 people. This is what we stand to lose if we stand by and watch as our dairy farmers close down. I am not willing to risk it. I also want to point out that the impacts of the loss of Pennsylvania's dairy industry will be felt throughout rural communities. As farmers go out of business, feed stores, fertilizer stores, and milk haulers go out of business, feed stores, fertilizer stores, and milk haulers go out of business. Without the economic engine provided by dairy, people are left out of work and our rural towns and counties will crumble. I will do everything in my power to prevent that from happening. I am committed to finding short-term relief to keep Pennsylvania dairy farmers in business while we make long-term fixes in Federal dairy policy in the next farm bill. I hope that all of my colleagues will support our hard-working dairy farmers and work with me to find commonsense solutions to avert an impending crisis in rural America.|110510|070328|460|Scr28mr07-200 1.txt|8010|8058|NONE|3148|539|PA|Robert P.

11020070072412|Mr. President, last Wednesday, April 11, terrorists exploded two bombs in Algiers, Algeria, killing 33 people and wounding over 200. The terrorist organization al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb took credit for the attacks, which targeted the Algerian Prime Minister's office and a police station. The attack occurred 1 day--1 day--after three would-be suicide bombers blew themselves up in Casablanca, Morocco, killing a police officer in the process. A fourth individual was shot before he could detonate his bomb. It also preceded, by only 3 days, attacks by two more would-be suicide bombers in Casablanca, Morocco, this time outside the American consulate and the American Language Center. The consulate subsequently closed. While a link between the Algeria bombings and the terrorists in Morocco has not yet been established, the confluence of these events demonstrates an increasingly deadly and dangerous situation in North Africa, for the region, for the United States, and for our friends and our allies. The bombings should also remind us of the need to be more globally focused in the fight against al-Qaida and its affiliates, which must be our national security priority. Yet the administration, fixated on Iraq, remains narrowminded in its focus and seemingly almost indifferent to last week's attacks in North Africa. Until last fall, al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb was known as the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat, or GSPC. It has been described by the State Department as a regional terrorist organization which recruits and operates in Algeria, Morocco, Nigeria, Mauritania, and Tunisia, as well as in Europe. In 2005, GSPC killed 15 people at a military outpost in Mauritania. Police in France, Italy, and Spain have arrested individuals suspected of providing support to the organization. GSPC has also called France ``public enemy number one.'' A French counterterrorism magistrate has described GSPC as the biggest terrorist threat facing his country today. Last year, al-Qaida leadership announced its formal ties to the GSPC, raising concerns about the extension of al-Qaida's deadly reach. In testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee this February, FBI Director Mueller warned of the possible consequences of this alliance, including to the United States. According to Mueller's testimony: Despite this clear threat, our Nation barely took notice of the attacks last week. The State Department issued a brief statement. The White House said virtually nothing--or nothing. Vice President Cheney mentioned them during a radio interview on Friday and again on Sunday, but only in passing, as a part of his repeated efforts to try to link 9/11 to the war in Iraq and to support an endless and disastrous war that is emboldening the members of al-Qaida and other terrorist organizations. Let me read exactly what the Vice President said: Amazingly, the only comments by the White House on these horrific attacks in north Africa were to insist that a terrorist attack in Algeria somehow proved that Iraq, more than 2,000 miles away, is the central front in the war on terrorism. The Vice President's assertions are not just factually wrong, they are offensive to the people murdered in Algeria last week, as well as their families and all those working hard to capture these terrorists. It is also indicative of everything that is wrong with this administration's national security policies. We should be directing our attention and resources to combating the threat posed by al-Qaida and its affiliates, wherever they may be. As we all know, this is not a conventional war. It requires better intelligence, better cooperation with friends and allies, stronger regional institutions, and diplomatic and economic policies designed to deny terrorists safe havens. It is not easy, and I have enormous respect for the men and women in our intelligence community, diplomatic corps, military, and other elements of our Government who are working hard to protect us from this threat. We should provide them our full support, not only in terms of resources but also with an effective global counterterrorism strategy rather than the current myopic and misguided focus on Iraq. First, we must improve our intelligence with regard to threats in Africa. The Intelligence authorization bill we were considering in the Senate earlier this week includes an amendment I offered with Senator Rockefeller calling for more intelligence resources to be directed to Africa. If we are to protect our national interests on the continent, we must commit ourselves to understanding not only the terrorist organizations that operate there but regional conflicts, corruption, poor governance, endemic poverty, and the historic marginalization that has allowed terrorists and other threats to fester. Second, we must expand and strengthen our diplomatic and foreign assistance activities in the continent. Our presence in far-flung parts of Africa, whether it be a new consulate or outpost or an expanded USAID development or public health program, exposes local populations to our Nation, linking us to parts of the world which, as we know, we can no longer afford to ignore. We need to help build strong governmental institutions that respect human rights and an equally vibrant civil society, while also strengthening the relationship between the two. Third, we need military policies that place counterterrorism in the context of a larger, more comprehensive strategy. Policies such as the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Initiative are important, particularly in improving the capacities of local governments. But unless they are part of bilateral and multilateral policies that emphasize human rights and democratization and anticorruption, our military resources may be squandered or, worse, may be even directed in counterproductive ways. For this same reason, I have supported the establishment of an Africa Command within the Defense Department, while insisting that its mission be squarely within the broader strategic goals of the United States on the continent. Fourth, we must develop effective policies for dealing with terrorist safe havens such as the one in the Sahel where al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb operates. According to the most recent State Department terrorism report, the organization not only trains, recruits, and operates in the region, it also raises money, including through smuggling. Clearly, confronting this organization requires addressing the root causes that have allowed it to develop and operate, whether they be poverty or corruption or the lack of government support to and presence in the region. We must develop comprehensive policies to confront these safe havens, including the settlement of regional conflicts and an adequate provision of economic and development assistance, so local populations can reject terrorist organizations. Fifth, we must help governments in the region in their efforts to confront terrorist organizations. The most recent State Department terrorism report stated that, in Mali, the sheer size of the country and the limited resources of the Malian Government ``hamper the effectiveness of military patrols and Border Patrol measures.'' The report also indicated Mauritania, another country where al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb operates, lacks funding and resources to combat terrorism. In order to combat international terrorist organizations such as the al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, we need regional strategies that address the capabilities and policies of all affected countries on a bilateral and multilateral basis. We must expand our assistance to these and other countries while ensuring that their counterterrorism policies are consistent with ours and that corruption and human rights abuses do not undermine efforts to combat terrorist organizations. Sixth, we must work closely with our European allies. Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb is a direct threat to Europe; our allies have every incentive to work with us. By working to establish mutually agreed upon approaches to counterterrorism, we can develop a strong, coordinated strategy that helps keep all of us safer. Seventh, we must encourage regional institutions to confront terrorism. For example, the African Union has established a Center for Study and Research on Terrorism to combat terrorism throughout the continent. This center and other regional initiatives are worthy of far more attention and support than we have thus far provided. Finally, we must at last recognize that the fight against al-Qaida is being undermined by the endless war in Iraq. As the NIE of last April concluded, the war has become a ``cause celebre'' for international terrorists. Moreover, tactics from Iraq are now being used around the world, including by terrorists in Algeria. As the State Department terrorism report noted: The horrific bombings last week in Algiers and the manifest threat in Morocco should remind us that our national security does not begin and end in Iraq. Indeed, Iraq remains a drain on our national attention to resources and an endless distraction from our real national security priorities, which is fighting al-Qaida and its affiliates. We cannot ignore the rest of the world to focus solely on Iraq. Al-Qaida is continuing and will continue to be a global terrorist organization. Contrary to what the administration has implied, al-Qaida is not abandoning its efforts to fight us globally so it can fight us in Iraq. No. Instead, it is forming alliances with groups like the GSPC, and it is seeking to attack us and our friends and allies around the world. By downplaying this threat, the administration is ignoring the lessons of September 11 and endangering our Nation. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.|110532|070418|10|Scr18ap07-150 1.txt|582|752|NONE|9814|1531|WI|Russ Feingold|S|NA|Democratic

With the provisions in this bill, Congress is deserting our commitments to our military leaders and telling them that none of it matters, the war is over and your mission is done. Congress, with this bill, is reneging on the war and sending our men and women in uniform a demoralizing message.

I do not support an open-ended commitment in Iraq. The Iraqi government must do more.

11020070083061|Mr. President, I rise to introduce The Crime Victims' Rights Rules Act, which would continue the work started in The Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, and Nila Lynn Crime Victims' Rights Act. The bill would make comprehensive procedural changes to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to protect crime victims' rights throughout the federal criminal process, thereby guaranteeing that crime victims' rights will be fully respected in our federal courts. As one of the Senate sponsors of the CVRA, I know that Congress intended the Act to bring dramatic changes to the way that the federal courts treat crime victims. Fortunately, in the two-and-a-half years since that legislation became law, positive strides have been made for crime victims. For example, with funding provided by act, the National Crime Victims Law Institute has been able to support crime victims' legal clinics around the country. I am also encouraged that court decisions have recognized the importance of crime victims' rights in the process. But while progress has been made in implementing the CVRA, at least one important step remains to be taken: The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure must be comprehensively amended to recognize the rights of crime victims throughout the process. The Federal rules have been described as ``the playbook'' for Federal judges, prosecutors, and defense attorneys. Currently, the Federal rules make virtually no mention of crime victims. If crime victims are to fully integrated into the daily workings of our criminal justice process, then their role in that process must be fully protected in the federal rules. I am encouraged to see that the Federal courts have been taking some modest steps toward protecting crime victims in the Federal rules. Federal district court judge Paul Cassell initiated the process by recommending rule changes to the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules. His comprehensive set of useful proposals appeared in an excellent law review article published in The Brigham Young University Law Review in 2005. In recent months, the Advisory Committee has adopted a few of his proposals to implement some aspects of the CVRA. These changes are expected to take effect next year. These amendments are positive, but far more remains to be done. The Advisory Committee's six proposed amendments, five changes to existing rules and one new rule, do little more than reiterate limited parts of the statute. Crime victims have been treated unfairly in the Federal criminal justice system for far too long to be left to rely on a handful of minimal protections. To respect crime victims' rights fully in the process, it is necessary to take more decisive and comprehensive action to thoroughly amend the rules. When Congress passed the CVRA in 2004, it promised that crime victims would have rights throughout the criminal justice process. Of particular importance, the CVRA guaranteed that crime victims would have the right to be treated with ``fairness.'' My proposed amendments would add to the Federal rules the changes needed to treat crime victims fairly. These changes to the rules would provide vital protections for crime victims without interfering with the rights of criminal defendants or the need for Federal judges to manage their dockets effectively. One example of the bill's changes is the amendment to Rule 50 to protect the victims' right to a speedy trial. The bill would amend Rule 50 to provide: ``The court shall assure that a victim's right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay is protected. A victim has the right to be heard regarding any motion to continue any proceeding. If the court grants a motion to continue over the objection of a victim, the court shall state its reasons in the record.'' It is hard for me to see how anyone could object to this procedural change. The CVRA promised to crime victims the right ``to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.'' The bill would place that right into the Federal rules. Another example of the kind of change that the bill would make is its amendment of Rule 21 to protect crime victims' rights in transfer decisions. In some situations, federal courts can transfer a criminal case from one district to another. The bill would amend Rule 21 to provide: ``The court shall not transfer any proceeding without giving any victim an opportunity to be heard. The court shall consider the views of the victim in making any transfer decision.'' It is again hard to understand how anyone could object to the requirement that a judge give a crime victim the chance to be heard before a case is transferred to a distant location. For example, the bill would have protected the right of the Oklahoma City bombing victims to present to the trial judge their views on whether the trial should have been transferred out of Oklahoma and, if so, to where. The bill does not mandate any particular substantive result, leaving it to the trial judge to make the ultimate determination about whether to transfer a case. But the bill would change the process by which such decisions are made, ensuring that victims are treated fairly by giving them an opportunity to provide their views to the judge. A further example of the changes in the bill is the amendment to Rule 48 to protect the victim's right to be heard before a case is dismissed. The bill would provide: ``In deciding whether to grant the government's motion to dismiss, the court shall consider the views of any victims.'' With this procedural change, the victim would have the opportunity to present the court any reasons why a case should not be dismissed. This right is implicit in the CVRA's mandate that crime victims be treated with fairness. It is hard to understand how a crime victim is treated with fairness if the court dismisses a case without considering the victim's position on the dismissal. Indeed, the only case to have considered this issue reached exactly this conclusion. As United States v. Heaton explains, I agree with Heaton that the CVRA requires that crime victims have the opportunity to submit their views to the court on any dismissal. That is why this bill would place this right specifically into the federal criminal rules. One particularly important part of the bill is its change to Rule 17 to protect the confidential and personal records of crime victims. The Advisory Committee itself proposed an amendment to Rule 17 to create specific procedures for subpoenas directed at confidential and private information concerning crime victims. This change was designed to prevent a recurrence of the problems that recently occurred in the Elizabeth Smart kidnapping case in Salt Lake City. My colleagues may remember this case, which involved the abduction of a teenaged girl from her home. Fortunately, she was found a year later and the suspected kidnapper apprehended. In the state criminal proceedings that followed, defense attorneys subpoenaed confidential school and medical records about Elizabeth. Because these subpoenas went directly to Elizabeth's school and hospital, she was never given the opportunity to object to them, and some confidential information was improperly turned over to defense counsel. The Advisory Committee has recognized that this same ``end run'' around the victim could occur under the federal rules. It has therefore adopted a rule requiring notice to crime victims before their personal and confidential information is subpoenaed. But this seeming protection has a catch: a defendant can avoid giving any notice to victim by arguing to a court, in an ex parte proceeding, that exceptional circumstances exist. This kind of ex parte procedure raises serious ethical concerns. In fact, the American Bar Association wrote to the Advisory Committee in February urging it to make certain that crime victims receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before such subpoenas issue. As Robert Johnson, Chair of the ABA's Criminal Justice section explained, the canons of judicial ethics forbid ex parte contacts with judges on substantive matters. Mr. Johnson went on to urge the Advisory Committee to give careful consideration of the ethical violations that might occur from ex parte subpoenas: It seems that the Advisory Committee's proposed rule permitting ex parte subpoenas of personal and confidential information of crime victims in some situations might run afoul of these ethical rules. Accordingly, under the bill, crime victims would enjoy an absolute right to notice before such information as psychiatric and medical records could be subpoenaed. This is the standard process that our adversary system of justice uses. The CVRA promised crime victims that they would enjoy ``the right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy.'' My bill would respect victims' dignity and privacy by giving them a court hearing before any of their confidential records could be turned over to an offender accused of victimizing them. This is not to say that such information will never be disclosed to the defense. A judge will have to make the determination whether disclosure is appropriate. But the judge would make that determination only after hearing from the prosecutor, defense counsel and most important of all the crime victim whose privacy rights are directly affected. One of the most significant parts of the bill is its creation of a new Rule 44.1, which would provide: ``When the interests of justice require, the court may appoint counsel for a victim to assist the victim in exercising their rights as provided by law.'' This important change builds on existing Federal law. Title 28 already permits the court in a criminal case to ``request an attorney to represent any person unable to afford counsel.'' For criminal cases involving child victims, Title 18 U.S.C. section 3509 allows the appointment of a guardian to represent the child's interests. Although the statutes provide these rights, they have yet to be actually implemented so that crime victims can actually take advantage of them. I want to be clear that I am not proposing that all crime victims should have counsel appointed for them. At the same time, though, I would think all could agree that there are situations where a trial court ought, as a matter of discretion, to have the ability to appoint legal counsel for a crime victim. For example, a crime victim might present a novel or complex claim that the courts have not yet considered. Or a crime victim might suffer from physical or mental disabilities as a result of the crime that would make it difficult for the victim to be heard without the help of an advocate. For many years, courts have had the ability to appoint counsel for potential defendants on a discretionary basis. My bill would allow that same, well-recognized power to be used to appoint counsel for crime victims. One last section of the bill deserves special note because it demonstrates the need for Congress to step into the rules process. The bill would amend Rule 32 to guarantee victims the right to speak at sentencing hearings. This is a change from the more limited right that the Advisory Committee has given victims the right ``to be reasonably heard.'' The Advisory Committee's note to this provision seemingly suggests that courts would not have to give all victims the right to speak at sentencing. This more limited right runs counter to the legislative history as to how the CVRA was to operate. While the CVRA gave crime victims the right to be reasonably heard, it was the undisputed legislative intent that victims would have the right to speak. I explained on the Senate floor at the time the act was under consideration that: My colleague Senator Feinstein remarked at that time that my understanding was her ``understanding as well.'' The Advisory Committee's action also contravenes at least two published court decisions on this issue. In United States v. Kenna, Judge Kozinski wrote for the Ninth Circuit that the CVRA's legislative history reveals ``a clear congressional intent to give crime victims the right to speak at proceedings covered by the CVRA.'' And in United States v. Degenhardt, Judge Cassell reached the same conclusion writing for the District of Utah. My bill would provide the right of victims to speak at sentencing hearings. Of course, prosecutors, defense counsel, and defendants have on enjoyed this right. Crime victims, too, deserve the opportunity to speak to the court to ``allocute'' as this right is called and to make sure that the court and the defendant understand the crime's full harm. I will not take the time here to go through all of the other provisions of the bill. But I did want to highlight one important note about the appropriateness of Congress acting to amend the rules to protect crime victims. Congress enacted the CVRA in October 2004. In the almost 3 years since then, I have waited patiently to give the federal courts the first opportunity to review the need for rule changes. At the same time, though, I have made clear my position, as one of the cosponsors of the CVRA, that Congress expected significant reforms in the Federal rules. As I explained to my colleagues at that time, the crime victims' community in this country was looking to the CVRA to serve as a model for the states and a formula for fully protecting crime victims. It was because the CVRA was expected to have such a far-reaching impact that the crime victims' community was willing to defer, at least temporarily, its efforts to pass a constitutional amendment protecting victims' rights. I made this point directly to the advisory committee in a letter I sent to Judge Levi on February 15 of this year. Thus, several months ago, I placed the Advisory Committee on notice that, if it failed to act to fully protect crime victims, Congress might step into the breach. A few weeks ago, Judge Levi replied to my letter, and I greatly appreciate his comments and explanations. In his reply, he acknowledged that many of the proposals were worthy of close attention. He indicated, however, that the Advisory Committee was going to delay action on them for some indefinite period of time. The reasons he gave for the delay were to: Judge Levi also suggested that some of the proposed rule changes would have created, in his view, new ``substantive rights'' for crime victims that went beyond the CVRA. Judge Levi's letter demonstrates why the Rules Enabling Act wisely left the final decision on how to structure rules of evidence and procedure to Congress. The letter refers to the need to ``gather more information'' and ``empirical data'' on crime victims'' issues before proceeding. While some might point out that the Advisory Committee has already had more than 2\1/2\ years to collect such data, I can appreciate the difficulty that a court rules committee can have in assessing the scope of a national problem. Congress, however, is already well-informed on the need for protecting crime victims' rights.|110439|070629|4|Scr29jn07-79 1.txt|581|856|NONE|15060|2484|AZ|Jon Kyl|S|NA|Republican

11020070093099|Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of Judge Michael B. Mukasey to become the Nation' s 81st Attorney General. Judge Mukasey has devoted more than 22 years to public service, 4 as a Federal prosecutor and more than 18 as a Federal district court judge for the Southern District of New York, one of the most prominent Federal district courts in the United States. For 6 years he was the chief judge. During his tenure on the bench, Judge Mukasey handled some of the most challenging cases in recent history. In 1995, he presided over the terrorism trial of the ``blind Sheik'' Omar Abdel Rahman and nine other defendants accused of plotting terrorist attacks on various sites in New York City. Rahman was also one of the terrorist masterminds of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. While presiding over the case of Jose Padilla--an American citizen who was later convicted of, among other things, conspiring to provide material support to al-Qaida--Mukasey issued key rulings that helped set judicial precedent in the war against terrorists. And in the wake of September 11, 2001, he presided over the difficult litigation of World Trade Center--related insurance claims. During these cases and throughout his career, Judge Mukasey's knowledge, integrity, and consummate fairness have won him the respect of his colleagues, the attorneys who appeared before him, and many others. In its opinion upholding the verdicts in the 1995 terrorism case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in an unusual public commendation praised Mukasey' s ``extraordinary skill and patience, assuring fairness to the prosecution and to each defendant and helpfulness to the jury.'' The court added, ``[h]is was an outstanding achievement in the face of challenges far beyond those normally endured by a trial judge.'' Judge Mukasey's career has been characterized by his commitment to upholding the rule of law. He has never served in a political role, and his nomination should be considered above the partisan fray. According to the Justice Department's mission statement, the Attorney General's first allegiance should be to ``the fair and impartial administration of justice for all Americans,'' not to any individual or political party. Indeed, Judge Mukasey's reputation for fairness and impartiality is so well-known and respected that the senior Senator from New York, Senator Schumer, even recommended him to be a Supreme Court justice. It is unfortunate, however, that despite the nonpolitical character of Mukasey's nomination, some Democrats may attempt to hold his nomination hostage in exchange for documents related to the firing of U.S. attorneys. Leaving aside the fact that Congress has no right to these documents, which are covered by executive privilege, Judge Mukasey's nomination has nothing to do with the firing of these U.S. attorneys. The President has nominated a distinguished and nonpolitical candidate. The Senate should reciprocate by using the confirmation process not to settle old scores or politicize the nomination, but to examine the qualifications of the nominee fairly. Since the Carter administration, attorney general nominees have been confirmed, on average, in approximately 3 weeks, with some being confirmed even more quickly. The Senate should immediately move to consider Judge Mukasey's nomination and confirm him before Columbus Day. The Justice Department needs an Attorney General with the foresight, experience, and resolve to lead the Nation's top law enforcement agency and tackle the difficult challenges presented by the post-9/11 world. I believe the qualities and background of Judge Michael Mukasey, combined with his extensive experience in national security and terrorism cases, commends him to serve as attorney general in these troubled times.|110439|070921|1|Scr21se07-20 1.txt|10|70|NONE|3814|594|AZ|Jon Kyl|S|NA|Republican

11020070098801|Mr. President, we have a lot to do, there is no question about that. But I said to one of my friends on the Republican side several days ago, when he was lamenting the fact that the President's standing was low and ours in Congress was low, I said to him: What do you hope to accomplish by denigrating the place you work in? You work here. What good is it to do that? He said: That is right, I will not do it anymore. I say to my friend from Kentucky, it is easy to find fault with what anyone does anyplace in life, including the Senate of the United States. But we have worked very hard these last 10 months to try to work on a bipartisan basis, to accomplish things for the country. We have done a pretty good job. We passed the minimum wage for the first time in 10 years. We passed a budget--a pay-as-you-go budget. No more red ink; we are paying for everything. That is different than the last 7 years under a Republican- controlled Congress. We passed a law mandating how U.S. attorneys should be appointed, as a result of the scandal in the Attorney General's Office. We mandated, through legislation, equipment for the Guard and Reserve that they simply didn't have. We are the ones who pushed the President to focus on having better equipment for our troops, including MRAPS, these vehicles that were more mine resistant. We passed that and it is in the form of a law. Because of the scandal at Walter Reed and other places, we have worked to protect veterans; hurricane recovery, Katrina. Our President made 22 trips down there, but there was no money until we forced money into the supplemental appropriations bill; SCHIP, we passed a law extending health care that 5.5 million children have to 10 million children. The President vetoed that. That is the matter before the Senate today. We are going to send that back to him, and I hope he will not veto it. We have made changes because Members on the other side wanted those changes made. Disaster relief for ranchers and farmers, we passed that. It is 4 years overdue. Wildfire relief, we have had these fires sweeping the West. We put $600 million in the supplemental so we can make up for some of the problems we had. As far as Iraq, we have had over 100 hearings on Iraq. That is 100 more than were held during the first 5 years of this war. The hearings have been good. It is true we have tried very hard to change course in the war in Iraq, and we have changed course, indirectly, as a result of the votes we have taken. It did not change it enough, but we have changed course in the war in Iraq. There will be other opportunities for us to do that in the near future. We have to do that. The President doesn't mind asking for another $200 billion of totally red ink--that is, borrowed money--for the war. But he is not willing to spend a few nonred dollars for children's health, paid for. Maybe the President is trying to protect the tobacco industry. I think they have had enough protection. A small increase in the tax on tobacco to pay for the children certainly seems reasonable. Stem cell research, we passed that. On ethics and lobbying, we passed the most significant reform in the history of the country, which is now law. The 9/11 Commission recommendations, there was a lot of talk about those recommendations. They were not put into law until we did it this year. We did it because it was the right thing to do. We reauthorized FDA. We passed WRDA-- which is years and years past due--by a huge bipartisan vote. Everything I have talked about has been bipartisan, even the votes on Iraq. We could not get 60 votes, but we had bipartisan support on Iraq. We all acknowledge we can do better. Certainly, we can do better. But I don't think we should lament the fact that we have not been able to do everything everyone wants done. With the Attorney General nominee, Judge Mukasey, a problem has arisen with that nomination. It seems like we are in the ``Twilight Zone.'' We are in the Senate talking about whether waterboarding is torture, and this man cannot acknowledge whether waterboarding is torture. I read this morning in the newspaper the reason he cannot do that is he is afraid if he says waterboarding is torture, it may create criminal or civil responsibilities for some of the people who did torture people through waterboarding. We are the United States of America, and we are concerned about talking openly about torture? I read a book a couple of years ago. The name of the book is ``1492.'' It talked about how our world changed in 1492. One of the reasons it changed is the Inquisition. It started in 1492, the same time Columbus discovered this Nation, this world. In 1492, they also discovered waterboarding, how to torture people, mostly Jews but not all Jews. Some Christians who were not Christian enough were waterboarded. Maybe we will work our way through Mukasey, but no one should be concerned about the fact that we have an obligation and a right to talk about torture. Shouldn't we know where the chief legal officer of this country, the Attorney General of the United States, stands on waterboarding, on torture generally? I look forward to our having a good day today and accomplishing a lot. We don't have a lot of time left in this legislative session. We have at the most about 6 weeks, but I hope during that period of time we continue to work together for the American people. That is what the American people want.|110489|071101|1|Scr01no07-131 1.txt|10|95|NONE|5432|987|NV|Harry Reid|S|NA|Democratic

11020070103884|Mr. President, as chairman of the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Subcommittee, I have mixed feelings as I rise to talk about the transportation and housing division of this Omnibus appropriations bill. This bill is the result of a lot of hard work, and there is a lot to be proud of. At the same time, I regret that over the last month, we have had to strip some $2.1 billion in resources from it. As all of us know, the Omnibus bill before us has a total cost that is slightly higher than the levels requested by President Bush, and much of the press coverage surrounding this bill has highlighted the fact that we have shrunk this bill down to the levels that were requested by the President. But when it comes to the transportation and housing division of this bill, I wish to make it clear to my colleagues that the budget reflected in this bill is not the President's budget. Instead, this bill makes great strides in rejecting President Bush's hardest and harshest cuts in transportation and housing, and it includes critical initiatives that are new that will make important improvements to transportation safety. I am proud of what this bill accomplishes. It provides funding to hire and train new air traffic controllers, and it rejects the President's efforts to cut funding to modernize the air traffic control system. It responds to our need to address crumbling infrastructure, especially our Nation's highway bridges, and it responds to the worsening congestion our families experience on our highways and our runways. This bill rejects the efforts by the administration to slash funding that would ease congestion at our airports. It rejects his efforts to push Amtrak into bankruptcy and leave millions of Americans stranded on the platform. And it rejects his attempt to walk away from the needs of millions of Americans who depend on the Federal Government to keep a roof over their heads, including our elderly and our disabled. Finally, this bill reaches a helping hand to the millions of families who are worried at this holiday season about whether they will be able to keep their homes in the coming year. Millions of people are facing foreclosure on their homes in the coming months as mortgage payments are rising out of control. There are communities in this country where every third home or even every other home is being abandoned by homeowners who cannot make their payments. This bill addresses that crisis by targeting almost a quarter of a billion dollars to ensure that our families get the counseling they need. This kind of housing counseling can make all the difference for homeowners who are struggling to make payments and to keep their homes. The amount this bill provides for housing counseling is more than 4\1/ 2\ times the level that was asked for by President Bush. Earlier this year, my very able partner Senator Bond and I held numerous hearings on the most important transportation and housing challenges that face this Nation. Together we negotiated every line of a very complicated spending bill with each other and then with our colleagues in the House. We were able to put together an appropriations bill that was reported, in fact, unanimously by our committee and passed the Senate with 88 votes. We then negotiated a conference agreement that earned the signature of every single conferee on both sides of the aisle on both sides of the Capitol. So we produced a truly bicameral, bipartisan bill. Unfortunately, even though House Democrats, House Republicans, Senate Democrats, and Senate Republicans were agreed on a balanced package that did address our transportation and housing needs, the one person who did not agree with us was President Bush. Because of that, we are blocked from sending our Transportation bipartisan bill to his desk for a veto. Since that time, we have had a couple of very difficult negotiations and, as a result, we have had to strip almost $2.1 billion of funding out of our part of the bill. There are real consequences to those additional cuts on which the President insisted. Transit riders across the country are going to ride in outdated buses because there is not enough money to replace them. Construction of new light rail systems in some of our most congested cities is going to be slow. Discretionary highway programs have been stripped of the dollars that would have been available for national competitions. Because of the President's demands, we were required to cut matching funds that we were sending to the States to support expanded passenger rail service. We reduced the initial commitment made by our conferees to expand the number of family unification vouchers. That is a program that provides the necessary housing assistance so foster children and their struggling parents can be reunited in a stable household. We were required to slow the release of a satellite navigation throughout our national aerospace. As I said, I have mixed feelings about this bill. We were dealt a very difficult hand by the President's budget demands, and in order to live within those constraints and move forward, we had to make some difficult cuts, and those cuts mean we have had to put off important investments in transit, in highways, and in community development, among many other areas. Still, I appreciate the work of my colleagues to ensure that this bill rejects the President's worst transportation and housing cuts. Instead, this bill responds to the most critical needs in transportation and housing and makes sure our broken bridges and highways get repaired, that our crowded airports are safe, Amtrak is protected from bankruptcy, and we are protecting our most vulnerable citizens from homelessness. Finally, I do want to spend a couple minutes on a related subject. In the last few days, the Appropriations and Finance Committees were able to reach an agreement on the way FAA funding will be made available in the future. I am letting my colleagues know, this past fiscal year was supposed to be the year Congress finished important legislation to reauthorize our Federal aviation programs. That included the core authorizations for the operations of the FAA, as well as the agency's procurement budget, research budget, and Federal grant program that are used to improve and expand our Nation's airports. I regret Congress was not able to make more progress on the legislation this year, but thankfully this appropriations bill now includes a number of important authorities and funding that will keep the FAA functioning and keep the airport and airway trust fund solvent. This conference agreement extends the current aviation excise taxes until the end of February, and it includes provisions to extend the existing war insurance risk program, as well as third-party liability protections. The bill also includes funding that rejects the President's proposed cuts to essential air service which guarantees air service to a lot of our rural communities, something about which many of us care. And it rejects the President's proposed cuts to our effort to modernize the air traffic control system and invest in airport infrastructure. Congress has not been able to finish the FAA reauthorization process in part because of the disagreements among the Senate committees about what their role is in overseeing and funding FAA programs. There are also disagreements about what type and mix of taxes and fees are supposed to be used to fund the FAA. But I am pleased to report that we have now successfully worked through one of those disagreements. Over the last 2 days, the two committees have come to an understanding about how funding for FAA programs will be moving forward. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the exchange of letters between the leadership of the two committees. There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:|110527|071218|13|Scr18de07-168 1.txt|244|508|NONE|7917|1319|WA|Patty Murray|S|NA|Democratic

11020080005578|Mr. Speaker, if you ask Mr. and Mrs America who are in the rural hamlets and the urban cities across America, they will tell you whether there is a recession or not. If you ask the automobile dealers, the home builders, if you ask the individuals who are attempting to put their children through college or even to make ends meet, they will tell you that bad news is already here; 63,000 jobs were lost last month. I am glad the Democrats are taking the opportunity to strengthen our economy and create jobs. Democratic leaders last week held a second economic forum. The forum convened national experts and talked about how we can create jobs. The New Direction Congress has already passed a bipartisan economic stimulus of which thousands of Americans will be receiving a payment because of the leadership of our Democratic majority. We are helping to create 500,000 jobs. But it is well to recognize that this administration just last month lost 63,000 jobs. What we need to do is bring our troops home, lower health care costs, and increase health care quality. We need to vote in the CHIP bill and stop the President's veto. We need to ensure that we lower energy prices through alternative fuels by creating hundreds of thousands of new green jobs. We have got to make college more affordable and K-12 classrooms more successful. We can empower America with our own initiative and our own genius. But we cannot do it if we have an administration that doesn't listen. Sixty-three thousand jobs lost tells the story, and Mr. and Mrs. America say, ``wake up and provide an opportunity for Americans.'' They want the Democrats to lead and to be able to create the opportunity for the economic engine that will save jobs and create jobs.|110383|080311|1|Hcr11mr08-78 1.txt|12|38|NONE|1738|303|TX|Sheila Jackson-Lee|H|18|Democratic

11020080015575|Madam Speaker, Ian Lustick, a professor of the University of Pennsylvania and research fellow at the Independent Institute in California, wrote an article in The Hill newspaper a few days ago which made a great deal of sense. He wrote this: ``Nearly 7 years after September 11, 2001, what accounts for the vast discrepancy between the terrorist threat facing America and the scale of our response? Why, absent any evidence of a serious domestic terror threat, is the war on terror so enormous, so all-encompassing, and still expanding? The fundamental answer is that al Qaeda's most important accomplishment was not to hijack our planes but to hijack our political system. For a multitude of politicians, interest groups, professional associations, corporations, media organizations, universities, local and State governments, and Federal agency officials, the war on terror is now a major profit center, a funding bonanza, and a set of slogans and sound bites to be inserted into budget, project, grant, and contract proposals. ``For the country as a whole, however, it has become a maelstrom of waste and worry that distracts us from more serious problems.'' Michael Chertoff, Secretary of Homeland Security, testified before the Senate a few months ago in a way no other Cabinet member probably ever has. He essentially said we are spending too much on security and should not let an over-exaggerated threat of terrorism ``drive us crazy,'' into bankruptcy, trying to defend against every conceivable threat. He went on to say: ``We do have limits and we do have choices to make. We don't want to break the very systems we're trying to protect. We don't want to destroy our way of life trying to save it. We don't want to undercut our economy trying to protect our economy, and we don't want to destroy our civil liberties and our freedoms in order to make ourselves safer.'' Secretary Chertoff was exactly right. I believe that most Members of Congress will vote for almost anything if the word ``security'' is attached to it so that they will not be blamed if something bad happens later. We should do some things to protect against terrorism, but we should not go overboard if we still believe in things like freedom and liberty. Actually, most security spending is more about money for government contractors and increased funding for government agencies than it is about any serious threat. Just 3 weeks after 9/11, when security requests for money were already pouring in, the Wall Street Journal hit the nail on the head in an editorial: ``We'd like to suggest a new post-September 11 rule for Congress: Any bill with the word 'security' in it should get double the public scrutiny and maybe four times the normal wait lest all kinds of bad legislation become law under the phony guise of fighting terrorism.'' The Wall Street Journal was exactly right. Unfortunately, Congress has not followed this good advice. But it is just as relevant today as it was when it first written. Bruce Fein was a high ranking Justice Department official during the Reagan administration. He says the Federal Government has, ``inflated the international terrorism danger in order to aggrandize executive power.'' This is true, in part. Most agencies and departments do exaggerate the threats or problems they are confronting to get more power. But they primarily do so to keep getting increased appropriations. Certainly, we need to take realistic steps to fight terrorism. But if we gave the Department of Homeland Security the entire Federal budget, we still could not make everyone totally safe. In a cost benefit analysis, you fairly quickly reach a point in the terrorism threat where more spending is almost totally wasted. People are hundreds of times more likely to be killed in a wreck or die from a heart attack or cancer. We need to spend more on the greatest threats. Also, we need to make sure we do not lose our liberty in a search for an illusive security. Bruce Fein wrote that if the, ``war against international terrorism is not confronted with corresponding skepticism, the Nation will have crossed the Rubicon into an endless war, a condition that Madison lamented would be the end of freedom.'' Madam Speaker, to sum up, a few people are getting rich at the expense of many by claiming that they are trying to increase our security. We don't need to make our already bloated Big Brother government even bigger just because some company or some bureaucrat callously uses the word ``security'' just to get more money and power.|110358|080520|2|Hcr20my08-141 1.txt|12|84|NONE|4538|760|TN|John J.

11020080017026|Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume I rise today in support of this resolution promoting National Men's Health Week. Across this Nation, men are reminded daily about the benefits of living a healthy life. Whether through exercise, a balanced diet, or regular visits to the doctor, these simple steps can lead to longer, more vibrant lives. Sadly, many men still neglect the basic preventative measures and often fail to realize the ripple effect their declining health can have on those around them. It is no secret that men have a shorter lifespan than women. Of the 10 leading causes of death in this country, men lead women in all 10. Yes, some of this can be attributed to lifestyle differences. Men are prone to engage in heavier drinking, smoking, and risky behaviors. But the sad reality is that men all too often neglect to seek out the medical help they need. Studies have shown that men are significantly less likely to visit the doctor than women are. Congress and the President established National Men's Health Awareness Week in May 1994. They chose the week leading up to Father's Day, when our focus on the male figures in our life is greatest, to bring national attention to the critical health issues facing men and to highlight the preventative measures that are necessary and available. Early detection is vital, and in many cases, increases chances for survival. Men's Health Awareness Week helps bring this information to light and highlights the proactive steps that men can take to improve their chances for a long, healthy life. The benefits of a more proactive approach to men's health extends not only to the individual, but to their families, friends, society, and the Nation. Better long-term health means fewer medical expenses for families, taxpayers, and employers. When women outlive their spouses, often by more than half a decade, they face the financial, emotional, and physical burden of living out their remaining years in solitude. This can ultimately place undue stress on a family or taxpayers. Men's Health Awareness Week helps broaden our understanding of the serious health risks facing men and the simple steps we can all take to help mitigate their effects. So I urge my colleagues not only to support this resolution, but to honor its message. If you're a man, go to the doctor. If you're a woman, encourage your husband, brother, son, and friends to do so. Take a walk, go for a jog, or eat a piece of fruit. After all, we all know that an apple a day keeps the doctor away.

11020080019378|Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and I won't use it all. Madam Speaker, this is a good rule for a great bill. And I was getting very confused as I heard my colleagues talking. The bill is the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008. This measure has received overwhelming support across the political spectrum because it balances fiscal responsibility, oversight and advancement. My colleagues protest rightly the accelerating price of gasoline for consumers in this country. And heating oil can't be far behind when winter comes. But to stand and say that the Speaker of the House of Representatives has not done anything about this particular matter ignores the fact that in the other body on just about every measure that has been proposed, some that have passed out of this body, the other body in the minority have stopped them in their tracks. Now I know back in April that the Speaker called on the President to suspend purchases of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and I regret that I am buying into the notion that you have accelerated that this good space bill now has become something to do with gas. As you know, the ranking Republican of the Science and Technology Committee, Representative Mr. Hall, and the ranking Republican on the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics, Representative Feeney, are both original sponsors of this bill. In fact, Representative Feeney praised the Democratic members and staff for crafting the bill in a bipartisan fashion from the beginning. And I too join with praising the staff on both sides for this measure. The underlying bill authorizes funds that will maintain NASA's current operations while allowing it to lay down the foundation to achieve future goals in the areas of space exploration and scientific research. Furthermore, the bill provides our need and desire for a better environment, educational opportunities, and improved national security. When we invest in quality programs like NASA, we are investing in the American people and the future of our country. NASA has undoubtedly contributed to the tremendous successes that America experienced in science and technology in the later part of the 20th century. If properly funded, NASA will ensure that America remains a world leader in science, space travel, and technology in the 21st century and beyond. Madam Speaker, I want to take just one more moment to respond to my friends who want us to lower gas prices. They are correct, but this body has, through the leadership of Nancy Pelosi, sought to crack down on oil price gouging, hold OPEC accountable for oil price fixing, and repeal subsidies for profit-rich Big Oil so we can invest in a renewable energy future. I want you to know that those measures alone have passed out of this House. Now let's just be for real here and stop scaring the American public. There is no Member of the House of Representatives or the United States Senate that does not want gas prices in this country to be lower. There is no Member that does not want food prices to be lower. All of us need to understand something, there is no short-term fix for the problem that we have gotten ourselves into, and the majority are the people that got us in most of this fix that we are in, and it is Democrats under Nancy Pelosi that are trying to pull us out of this hole that we got ourselves in.|110109|080611|33|Hcr11jn08-115 1.txt|790|845|NONE|3400|584|FL|Alcee L.

11020080021963|Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume. Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank Chairman Rangel and Chairman Oberstar for their tireless efforts in trying to seek a long-term funding solution for our Nation's aviation programs. Last year, I was honored to chair a hearing in the Select Revenue Measure Subcommittee where we heard from all sides on this issue, including the chairman and ranking member of the Transportation Committee and Aviation Subcommittee. Unfortunately, our colleagues on the other side of the Hill have not been able to secure an agreement, and that's really why we're here today to provide some additional time for negotiations. H.R. 6327 extends the financing and spending authority for the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. The trust fund taxes and spending authority are scheduled to expire on June 30, 2008. H.R. 6327 extends these dates at current rates for 3 months through September 30, 2008. Previous legislation extending these taxes were unanimously reported out of the Ways and Means Committee with bipartisan support. The substitute amendment makes one change from the bill as introduced. It deletes section 5 which would have transferred $8 billion to the Highway Trust Fund. This provision would prevent cuts in highway programs next year. CBO has informed us that it would have no budgetary impact. While that provision enjoys significant bipartisan support, a number of Republican Members have indicated strong opposition. It is imperative that we enact the FAA provisions this month. To ensure that we have the necessary two-thirds support to pass this bill today, we decided to remove the highway language. This bill will keep the Airport and Airway Trust Fund taxes and operations in place until a long-term FAA reauthorization act is signed into law. The bill also includes a number of authorizing provisions under the jurisdiction of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which worked with Ways and Means to develop the legislation. The most important of these is the Airport Improvement Program, or AIP. This program funds grants for projects throughout the country. Many of our airports rely on this program to help finance critical modernization and expansion efforts. The bill would extend the AIP for another 3 months. The other authorizing provisions are also 3-month extensions. Mr. Speaker, this is a temporary extension of an essential funding mechanism for our aviation programs, and I urge its adoption. I reserve the balance of my time.|110189|080624|6|Hcr24jn08-104 1.txt|98|139|NONE|2512|402|MA|Richard E. Neal|H|2|Democratic
11020080023670|Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Preserve America and Save America's Treasures Act, which will, as the two speakers already have said, authorize two programs that are critical to the future of America's historic preservation efforts. I want to thank Chairman Rahall and Ranking Member Young of the Natural Resources Committee, as well as Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member Bishop of the National Parks, Forests and Public Lands Subcommittee, for their work in shepherding this legislation, as well as the historic preservation community for their support for this bill. The Save America's Treasures Program was started as part of the White House Millennium Council chaired by then-First Lady Hillary Clinton. The program has provided much-needed bricks and mortar support and has succeeded beyond anyone's expectations, funding America's most threatened cultural treasures for almost 10 years. The current administration, under the leadership of First Lady Laura Bush, created the Preserve America Program to support community preservation efforts by providing funding for heritage tourism and preservation planning. The two programs serve different purposes, and together, they provide a comprehensive approach to preservation and community revitalization. Mr. Mike Turner and I announced the Preserve America and Save America's Treasures Act in the Sewall-Belmont House, just a couple of blocks from here. The Sewall-Belmont House was designated a national historic landmark for its significance in American history. It was the headquarters for the National Woman's Party, led by Alice Paul, and their movement to secure women the right to vote. Despite that obvious historical significance, it was not long ago that the Sewall-Belmont House was threatened by a leaking roof and by significant other structural damage. The Sewall-Belmont House was the first building to receive funding as a Save America's Treasures project. In my own district, Save America's Treasures funding has helped preserve the F.W. Woolworth Building in downtown Greensboro. Mr. Speaker, as you know well, on February 1, 1960, four African American students from North Carolina A&T University sat down at the ``white only'' lunch counter and refused to move until they were treated the same as the white customers. Within 2 months, the sit-ins at Woolworth's inspired similar demonstrations throughout the South involving thousands of protesters. The sit-in at the Woolworth's lunch counter was the moment when the civil rights struggle in this country became a mass movement. The Woolworth Building and its lunch counter are sacred grounds of the civil rights movement and must be preserved for future generations. The Preserve America Program has designated more than 500 neighborhoods, cities, and towns throughout the United States as Preserve America Communities and has awarded grants since 2006. Earlier this year, the Department of the Interior made its first round of 2008 grants of $2.9 million to 43 projects in 25 States. This September they will award an additional $4.3 million in grants. The projects support heritage tourism, the commercial revitalization of neglected downtowns, and the reuse of historic properties. Mr. Speaker, America's historic places remind us of who we are. They remind us of our history. We cannot cheat our children of that connection with their past, that understanding of who they are. The Preserve America Program, through its grant opportunities and community designations, ensures that important communities and neighborhoods will survive for future generations. Historic preservation helps revitalize cities, towns, and rural areas nationwide where dramatic population shifts, outdated planning, and the loss of manufacturing jobs have made market-driven reinvestment impossible without some assistance. Rehabilitation of vacant and underused historic structures can attract new investment in growing communities. Whether it is preserving main streets of downtowns, or reusing historic properties as affordable housing, preservation makes history come alive in communities throughout the country. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the House is now considering these two successful programs. Through passing this bill and authorizing these programs, Congress can affirm our commitment to saving our natural heritage, our historic heritage, and revitalizing our communities. Once again, I ask my colleagues for their support for the Preserve America and Save America's Treasures Act.|110300|080708|9|Hcr08jy08-96 1.txt|355|426|NONE|4517|673|NC|Brad Miller|H|13|Democratic
11020080024843|Mr. Speaker, last week, I received a notice from the Chief Administrative Officer and the Architect of the Capitol directing me to remove a memorial located outside of my office that honors fallen Marines from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. The notice stated that the Faces of the Fallen memorial does not comply with the new hallway policy of the House. However, memorials to honor the lives of those killed in Iraq and Afghanistan are respectfully displayed and should not fall under the Hallway Policy's jurisdiction. In 2004, Congressman Rahm Emanuel and I introduced legislation calling for an exhibit in the Capitol Rotunda to honor U.S. servicemembers who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan. Our legislation was never considered. Instead, House Speaker Dennis Hastert directed the construction of a memorial listing names of the fallen in the foyer of the Rayburn House Office Building. Because we believed more should be done to honor the lives of our fallen servicemembers, I, along with other Members of Congress, began to display more proper memorials outside our individual offices. Hundreds of visitors from my district and others have stopped to view the faces of fallen Marines from Camp Lejeune displayed outside my door. It is seeing the faces of these Marines, the fathers, the mothers, the sisters, the brothers, the sons and the daughters that deeply impact these visitors. Since the media has reported the attempt to remove the Faces of the Fallen memorial displayed outside my office, I have heard from constituents and people across the country who believe these memorials should remain on display. An article published yesterday in the Jacksonville Daily News distributed in the area surrounding Camp Lejeune quoted two women who understand what it means to lose a loved one who has served our Nation. Mr. Speaker, I would like to submit the article for the Record. The article quotes Deborah May, a woman whose husband was killed in Iraq in 2003. She told the Jacksonville Daily News that she has walked through the hallways of the House office buildings and she supports the memorials on display. And I quote Mrs. May: ``When I go, I take my small children with me. The very least they could do is put a picture there to show my children that my husband is remembered and that this is what our government is about and our country and the freedoms we have.'' The article also quotes Vivianne Wersel, the president of the Surviving Spouses Support Group at Camp Lejeune, who said that the memorial is as much as an icon as the American flag. And I quote her: ``These servicemembers have given their lives for a conflict and something they believed in. I think that it is a reminder for those that are visiting Congress and that is what America is all about. They can walk the halls of Congress because of these young men that have given them the freedom to speak and the freedom to live.'' Last week, I wrote a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi to explain the history behind these memorials and to ask her support in preserving their display. I know she understands the importance of honoring the servicemembers who have sacrificed for our Nation. And I thank her for honoring my request that the House observe a moment of silence each month to remember those killed or wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan. I hope that Speaker Pelosi will agree with many of us in Congress and people across this Nation that these memorials should remain on display. And before closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to show a picture of a child whose father died in Iraq for this country. This is a picture of Tyler Jordan whose father, Phillip Jordan, was a gunnery sergeant with the United States Marine Corps. And this young man is receiving the flag on his father's grave on his coffin. Four years ago, I had this picture sent to me so I could blow it up. And I want to say this to Tyler Jordan: Your daddy, Phillip Jordan, is on this poster. He was killed along with others in the year 2003. A name means a lot to those who are not here any longer. But nothing means more than for a child to come to Washington and to see his father's face outside a congressional office. So again I have great respect for Speaker Pelosi. And I hope she will agree with us that these posters should remain outside the Members of Congress' office. And with that, Mr. Speaker, I ask God to please bless our men and women in uniform and to please bless the families of our men and women in uniform. And I ask God to please bless America and help us to see the way to always remember those who died for this country and not forget them. God bless America.|110290|080714|2|Hcr14jy08-72 1.txt|12|169|NONE|4628|816|NC|Walter B. Jones|H|3|Republican
11020080026275|Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this misguided, misdirected legislation. After seeing this bill defeated just 2 weeks ago, I quite honestly am surprised that we are back for one more attempt at it. It is really heartwarming to find my colleague from West Virginia, the chairman of my committee, saying ``drill America now.'' The only thing is I am wondering why the chairman did not allow us to have amendments that would allow us to drill now. If he would allow us the amendments that would stop the litigation that is stopping us from drilling now, maybe we could work through some of those 68 million acres, if he would allow us to have amendments which would stop the regulatory process that is delaying unnecessarily and is of no benefit to the American consumer, maybe we could drill now. But I find the chairman's comments just hard to believe. In the context of the discussion today, I would invite the chairman to sign on to a letter with me. The letter is from myself and several other Members asking just in one area, one area where we find bureaucratic delays, 7 years in Utah, the BLM has not issued the resource management plans that are required in order to develop just that. If the chairman of the committee is intent on drill, drill, drill, as he says today, let him just put his one signature beside mine, and we will send it to Nancy Pelosi and send it to the President of the United States from Nancy Pelosi and us in the House and the Members of the Senate. One place where we have some of that 68 million acres, 1 million of the 68 million acres, and let's just work one block at a time to figure out exactly what the roadblocks are because I believe, I believe in my heart that the majority does not want to drill today. I believe that they understand that it is not the oil companies who lack the diligence, but it is instead roadblocks by people who have hijacked the energy policy of this country. In my section of the debate we will talk about the reason the 68 million acres lie unused, and it will go from regulatory process to litigation. It will go into the problems of seismic that are being blocked up along the northern end of this country. We will talk about the delays one step at a time. But let's talk just a little bit about the bill before us today. It is several sections. The first section I want to talk about directs the sale of the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, the NPR-A. Now that is curious that the Democrats on the floor of the House today do not want to open up ANWR, 2,000 acres. They have been concerned about the environmental degradation of the 2,000 acres of ANWR, and yet today they are saying that they are going to open up 23 million acres to environmental degradation. There is not one bit of infrastructure. There are no roads. There are no drilling pads. There are no pipelines. They are hundreds of miles away from where they need to be for the market. Yet with ANWR, with a 74-mile pipeline, it is sincerely believed that we could get production down to the continental United States within a year. The Trans-Alaska Pipeline, 800 miles long, took 3 years to have it built and full of oil because this Congress, at that point in time, realized that they could make a difference and they did make a difference by saying that this pipeline is not going to be delayed by litigation. If the gentleman from West Virginia says drill and drill now, then let him make the equal commitment that we will not allow our production to be delayed by litigation which is going to come from every sort of environmental group, either in the NPR-A or ANWR or the Outer Continental Shelf. It is really difficult to believe that the majority is sincere when they say drill today, and on the other side of the spectrum we see all sorts of delaying mechanisms from people who contribute money to them. I was interested in the last debate to find that oil companies contribute money to Republicans and therefore there is some scheme. When I look at the bill in front of us today, I see groups, I see an alliance with groups that contribute a lot of money to Democrats. I see over $670 million in the last several years from trial lawyers. There is new language in this bill which will be litigated probably for decades. I see a section in this bill, section 5, that requires project labor agreements, and I see that the unions have given to the Democrats over $1 billion. And then I find the continuing language which says that there are going to be protections in place that satisfy environmental groups; and again, environmental groups have invested over $1 billion in Democrat candidates. So when I hear from the other side their observations about the special interests, I think we should look at the bill. Section 2 requires again the direction that any leases be environmentally responsible. That is new language. Sections 3 and 4 deal with pipeline requirements that companies tell me that they have to currently comply with already, so it appears to be a duplication. The project labor agreements are brand new. These are things where private companies are directed that they will, before they can work on any private project, have labor agreements in place. Then we have a ban that is reinstated on exporting Alaskan oil. Keep in mind that it was Democrat President Bill Clinton that opened up the Alaskan oil to be exported. So again, we find now the flip-flop in that position on their part. The ban was originally in place, and President Clinton decided he would relieve that ban. And now we find it being put back in place. The issuance of new leases, use it or lose it, frankly is already in place in law. There is language that currently states that if you do not use a lease, you lose it. So either this bill is simply to try to convince the American people that we are doing something when we are actually not, or it is even worse than that. I believe that we have no purpose for this bill. I believe that this bill is not going to increase the amount of domestic energy one bit. I think that what it is going to do is to start anew, it is going to start new processes and are going to delay even by months the process in place for the NPR-A. So while it is telling us we are going to drill now and drill in the NPR-A, actually it is doing the exact opposite. It is instituting new rules that will have to go through a completely new process. Mr. Speaker, I look forward to the debate. I reserve the balance of my time.|110257|080717|9|Hcr17jy08-99 1.txt|290|518|NONE|6544|1202|NM|Stevan Pearce|H|2|Republican

11020080034994|I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Illinois for his hard work on this important issue. We are so delighted, Bobby, to see you back. We look forward to continuing our work with you. Thank you so much for everything you have done, and, also, the gentleman from Nebraska . I would to also thank our chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Dingell, the gentleman from Michigan for his strong support of this legislation. This passed unanimously out of the Energy and Commerce Committee in a bipartisan way and in no small part due to the people I have mentioned before. I also want to thank the dedicated majority and minority staffs of the Consumer Protection and Telecommunications subcommittees for their diligent work in crafting an excellent bipartisan, compromise bill. Madam Speaker, the prepaid calling card market is a $4 billion industry. In a recent independent study it was found that, on average, companies failed to provide 40 percent of the minutes guaranteed by the card, costing consumers hundreds of millions of dollars a year. This fraud harms segments of the population who are least able to afford it, the poor, recent immigrants, minorities and seniors, and the companies don't stop there. They have even preyed upon our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is unconscionable and obviously un-American. This legislation would end the deception and the fraud that these people have suffered at the hands of unscrupulous companies. Now, the bottom line for this bill is this is a consumer protection bill. If we are in favor of protecting the consumer, then we should vote for this bill, because it's very, very simple. People have a right to know that when they buy a prepaid calling card, what they see is what they get. If a card says you get 60 minutes of calling time, then that consumer who buys the card is entitled to 60 minutes of calling time. What we find in little small print that nobody can see or understand, there are so many hidden fees. Some calling cards say that you only can get the 60 minutes if you call at certain times. But if you don't call at other times, you don't get the minutes. Then the time you get the minutes is only from 2 to 4 a.m., which is ridiculous. Some cards charge you 3 units, 3 minutes of call time if you get a busy signal. Or 3 minutes of call time if you are just connected, as for a connection charge, even if it was across the street or in the same State. So consumers don't want to think they are being defrauded. Consumers are entitled to get what they pay for. Sometimes there are companies that are very legitimate. Most of the companies are legitimate. If a company says that you get 60 minutes of calling card, and it's a legitimate card, and that card may be a little bit more expensive than the fraudulent card, the unsuspecting consumer will buy the cheaper card thinking that he or she will get a better deal, when, in reality, the 60 minutes may only be 30 or 32 or 35 minutes. The bottom line is this, if you are for the consumer, if you are for truth in marketing, then you should support this bill. If you are not, and you want things to go along the way they have been, then don't vote for the bill. I am so delighted that we have bipartisan consideration on this and that, in a bipartisan fashion, we all agree that this is something that really should pass. Nobody, nobody should be against this, not the telecom companies, not consumer groups, not any Members of Congress. If we want to stand for legitimacy and say that we want to protect the consumer, and that we want people to understand that when they purchase something, they know what they are getting, then we ought to all vote for this bill. I thank my colleagues. This is a tremendous victory for the consumers in America.|110275|080925|9|Hcr25se08-295 1.txt|376|437|NONE|3788|682|NY|Eliot L. Engel|H|17|Democratic
11020080035515|That being the case, Mr. Speaker, ``man is man plus his circumstances.'' That is one, I think, of the wisest sayings I have ever heard by one of the great philosophers of the 20th century, Jose Ortega y Gasset, who led a fascinating life. He was a professor in various universities in Spain, actually dabbled in politics, was a member of the parliament during the Second Republic in the 1930s in Spain, and then was a long-time exile. Toward the end of his life, I think he returned to Spain but just for a short period of time because he did not outlive the Franco dictatorship and Ortega y Gasset never wanted to live nor, quite frankly, visit his country under dictatorship. But that phrase, ``man is man plus his circumstances,'' I think, summarizes so much of life. And so we today, while not engaged, because this is a procedural debate and I would expect my friend on the other side of the aisle to agree that perhaps it is not one of the most popular to watch if a guest were here in the galleries because it is procedural, this debate. And yet process really is key to the functioning of representative democracy, Mr. Speaker. Why do I say that: because the rights of the minority are just as important as the right of the majority to rule. You can't have a functioning, a genuine, representative democracy unless, along with the right of the majority to rule, the minority has the right to be heard. And the opposition, the minority, has the right to play a significant role. And so process is what makes that possible. Without process, guaranteeing the rights of the majority to rule and the minority to be heard and to have all of the procedural rights followed by the majority, without that process, there can be no representative democracy. And so even though this debate may seem somewhat technical, process is important.

11020080036263|Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, this bill contains what we believe are noncontroversial measures proposed by the Judicial Conference to improve efficiency in the Federal courts. Many have passed the House in a prior Congress in similar forms. The bill makes some realignments in the place of holding court within specified judicial districts so as to better serve local communities. It permits a chief pretrial services officer to be chosen locally by the district court, just like the chief probation officer. It updates the penalty for failure to appear for jury duty, or lying on a questionnaire to avoid jury duty, by raising the maximum fine from $100 to $1,000, and by allowing the judge to impose community service. The bill also increases the maximum penalty for employers who retaliate against employees who are called to serve on jury duty. Other updates include making electronically produced information coverable in court costs, and adding magistrate judges to the list who can be included in circuit Judicial Conferences. I think this bill, while noncontroversial, is certainly important in increasing the efficiency of our judicial branch, and I hope that we will unanimously support it.

11020080050955|Mr. President, I have sought recognition to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Israel's founding. On May 14, 1948, members of the Jewish People's Council gathered at the Tel Aviv Museum to approve the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel. The declaration stated, in part, ``The State of Israel will be open for Jewish immigration and for the Ingathering of the Exiles; it will foster the development of the country for the benefit of all its inhabitants; it will be based on freedom, justice and peace as envisaged by the prophets of Israel; it will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex; it will guarantee freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture; it will safeguard the Holy Places of all religions; and it will be faithful to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.'' These were the principles Israel was founded on, and these same principles guide it today. I have visited Israel 25 times since taking office in 1981. Under the able leadership of the numerous Israeli leaders whom I have come to know over that period, Israel has remained a bastion of democracy in the Middle East. According to the Freedom House's ``Freedom in the World 2008'' report, Israel is the only free country in the Middle East. Evidence of Israel's strong democratic traditions is seen in the inquisitiveness of its press: the Freedom House considers the Israeli press to be the only free press in the region. Israel's economy has also prospered under democratic rule. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit, ``Israel's economy is far more diversified and sophisticated than its neighbors.'' ``Israel has the highest proportion of engineers in the workforce [worldwide], and nearly double the share of second-place US and Japan.'' Its well- educated populace has enabled its high-tech industry to make advances in research and development, enabling Israeli firms ``to achieve global leadership in a number of fields, including various segments of the software industry, anti-virus protection and computer security systems, as well as in the areas of fiber optics and electro-optics, medical instruments and medical imaging systems.'' During my time in the Senate, I have worked to ensure Israel's security. One aspect of this has been securing economic and military assistance for Israel. During my most recent trip to Israel, in December 2007, I met with President Shimon Peres and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. We discussed, among other things, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, Iran's role in the region, and the U.S.-Israeli bilateral relationship. In each instance, it was clear to me that both the United States and Israel benefit greatly from our strong ties and shared ideals. At the core of the United States-Israeli relationship is the Middle East peace process. There have been so many developments since Israel emerged as a state. The enmity which has existed for decades has meant senseless killing, terrorism in Israel, and Hezbollah and Hamas firing rockets into Israel, prompting the justified retaliation by Israel as a matter of self defense. It is crucial that Israel's neighbors understand the importance of words and perceptions in the peace process, bringing the region closer to the goals set forth in the November 27, 2007 Joint Israeli- Palestinian Declaration at Annapolis: ``We express our determination to bring an end to bloodshed, suffering and decades of conflict between our peoples; to usher in a new era of peace, based on freedom, security, justice, dignity, respect and mutual recognition; to propagate a culture of peace and nonviolence; to confront terrorism and incitement, whether committed by Palestinians or Israelis.'' The democratic principles set forth in the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel have enabled Israel to thrive for the past 60 years and will continue to guide it into the future.|110509|080514|2|Scr14my08-179 1.txt|70|133|NONE|3984|637|PA|Arlen Specter|S|NA|Republican

11020080058634|Mr. President, I wish to go back to the discussion about the subject we want to devote a lot of attention to this week, and that is gas prices. Senator Bond spoke to that issue a little earlier. We are going to be going to that issue tomorrow. It is critical that we address this problem before the August recess in a couple of weeks. Forty-four Republicans have cosponsored the Gas Price Reduction Act, about which Senator Bond spoke. It is a balanced approach to our energy crisis. It recognizes the need for additional production, as well as dealing with the demand side. In other words, use less, find more, and to do so here at home, to use American energy to solve this American crisis. That way we can have more control over our own destiny, a point I will be making in a moment. The other side, though, has decided to approach this problem with a very narrow and limited approach dealing with so-called speculators. Speculators are people who trade in crude oil. There is a view that speculators actually affect the price when they buy it or sell it. The first point I wish to make is the opposition always talks about driving up the price when speculators buy, but they never bother to mention that every time you buy, somebody else sells. So it is a little hard to see how speculators are responsible only for the increase. As a matter of fact, last week was the largest drop in oil prices ever in our history, at least in the last couple of decades, over $20. I don't think anybody blamed the speculators for the decline, or maybe I should say they didn't cheer the speculators for the decline or drop in oil prices. So it is a little odd every time the price goes up, it is the speculators' fault, but when the price goes down, well, maybe that is the market forces taking control. The reality is that for every purchase, you have to have someone who is selling. I did think it was interesting that the majority leader was here earlier and he actually attributed that decline to the fact that we were talking about legislation dealing with speculators. I see no evidence to support that claim and, in fact, I will cite some evidence quite to the contrary in a moment. But it reminds me of a great fable writer by the name of Stephen Leecock who tells the story about the two fleas on the back of the Roman chariot. They look back and say: My, what a fine cloud of dust we are creating. It seems to me that is pretty similar to contending this speculation bill caused the drop in prices. I think we all know what it was. When President Bush announced the end of the Executive moratorium on drilling, that is when the prices went down. As a matter of fact, Joseph Trevisani, who is the chief market analyst for a company called FX Solutions, said a few days ago: He went on to say: That is the point. When we start seriously talking about eliminating the ban on production, that is when prices will go down. Why is that? Speculators are actually very smart researchers who are trying to figure out whether demand will exceed supply or supply will exceed demand some time in the future--16 months out, 18 months, 2 years, 5 years, whatever it might be. They do a lot of research to try to figure this out. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that if you have a legal ban on more production and you lift that ban, obviously you are going to potentially produce a lot more crude oil. That increase in supply will obviously affect the price because it will then exceed the demand or at least it will keep pace with demand. That is simple market economics. That is what happened last week. It illustrates the fact that while there are those who say if we increase our production, it is going to take 3 to 7 years before we will see any of that production, the mere fact that we are getting serious about doing it was enough to reduce prices. I suspect if we actually pass a law that does it, the prices will decline even further and will continue to decline as progress is made toward increased production. The reality is that prices rise and fall depending on a lot of events that are outside our control, and we need to bring more of those decisions within our control. There is a hurricane in the gulf. Iran is rattling its sword in the Middle East. Those kinds of things cause the prices to go up because there is a suggestion that the supply may be interrupted in the future. Then by the same token, we react to good news, as occurred last week. When the President says we are going to remove the moratorium that by Executive order has been placed on production and Congress says we are considering legislation to remove the congressional moratoria as well, speculators react to that as well. The other side, which says it is all the speculators who are to blame for the rising prices, might as well blame the weatherman for bad weather. His job is to do the research and predict what the weather is going to be. Muzzling him and saying he cannot talk about the weather is not going to create sunny days next week. Those days are going to come because of weather factors, not because the expert in the field is predicting it one way or the other. It is the same thing with these so- called speculators who are in the business of buying, whether it is for an airline or a pension fund or for whomever. Their job is to try to determine what the market price should be at any given time. I talked about trying to gain more control of it ourselves. Unfortunately, there are a lot of producers in the world that have an interest in increasing the price of oil and have the means of doing so by simply acting badly. I am speaking of countries such as Russia, Iran, and Venezuela. In Iran, we know they have rattled their sword in the past, and that not only advances their national policy goals, but it also has a tendency to cause panic in the market and, therefore, the prices go up because there is a view there may not be an adequate supply for the demand we have. For example, I note the fact that all of the oil through the gulf--it is not just Iranian oil; it is from the Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and other countries. About two-fifths of all globally traded oil goes through the Strait of Hormuz, and Iran is on one side of the Strait of Hormuz. They have their ships in the area. At one time or another they have tried to interfere with the shipping traffic lanes through the Strait of Hormuz. For example, in June 2006, the threat of Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon created quite a stir among New York traders, and that drove the price of oil up to nearly $80 a barrel. In 2007, five armed Iranian boats approached three U.S. Navy warships in international waters, taking aggressive actions. The Pentagon described it as ``reckless and dangerous.'' The incident only lasted about 20 minutes. As a result, there was a brief spike in oil prices as soon as that was reported on CNN. The reality is that a country such as Iran can have an effect on the price of oil. What we need to do is get away from that kind of situation. The same thing is true of Russia. I talked about this the other day. Russia has a tendency when it wants--by the way, it is the second largest producer ahead of Saudi Arabia--when it wants to affect the price of oil or national policy, it can cut off the supply of oil or natural gas, and that can result not only in shivers running through the countries of Europe, particularly Eastern Europe which relies on this natural gas and oil, but also affects the world price. I note that Gazprom, which is Russia's natural gas monopoly, controls a lot of other things as well. Its former chairman is Dmitry Medvedev, the new President of Russia. It alone accounts for 25 percent of the country's tax revenues. So this is a major deal. Russia has used Gazprom as a political tool in more than one situation when it affected Ukraine after that nation allegedly failed to pay debts to Russia, or other European countries, such as the Czech Republic when it said it would cooperate with the United States in missile defense. Let me conclude with Venezuela. President Chavez of Venezuela has repeatedly threatened to cut off oil from that country. A 2006 GAO report stated this cutoff could amount to increased oil prices of $11 per barrel and would cut American GDP by $23 billion. The point here is that the United States needs to gain more control over its own destiny. We are the third largest producer in the world. We have vast resources of natural gas and crude oil, as well as other resources, such as coal, uranium, and others, but we have an aversion to produce in this country because of the not-in-my-back-yard problem associated with wherever that production might be. As a result, Republicans have proposed legislation that would remove the moratoria that currently preclude production and provide incentives to States to permit offshore. Even though it is far off of their State limits, in Federal waters, it would at least provide an incentive for them to agree to production offshore, thus enhancing American production and more control over our own destiny. That is the point I want to conclude with. It is time to gain control of our own destiny. It will enable us to affect the prices ourselves by producing more and, thus, reducing prices, not relying so much upon other countries, which can adversely affect the price by withholding production or creating conflict in the world. It will enable us to develop the resources safely in an environmental way, because we know how to do that. We know we can't conserve our way out of the problem. We know the so-called renewables can only meet a small fraction of our needs. And we further know that regulating speculators is not going to produce one additional drop of oil. So that is why Republicans have focused on more energy production--American energy for American consumers--as a way to become less energy dependent and affect the price in a meaningful way, a way which could permit us, as we saw last week, to drastically reduce the price of oil almost overnight if Congress were to pass this legislation. I urge my colleagues, when we take this matter up, as Senator Bond said, to permit a full and free debate, and amendments that we have to offer here, so at the end of the day Congress can complete our work over the next couple of weeks by passing meaningful legislation to reduce the cost of oil and, therefore, importantly for American consumers, the price we pay at the pump.|110439|080721|11|Scr21jy08-42 1.txt|292|457|NONE|10489|1910|AZ|Jon Kyl|S|NA|Republican
