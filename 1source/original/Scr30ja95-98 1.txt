                   THE PASSING OF LORNA KOOI SIMPSON
  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today for a short tribute to a lady 
from Wyoming who passed away last week, a lady who certainly was a rare 
and wonderful gem, not only for Wyoming but for this country as well. 
She was someone that I had the great privilege of knowing and admiring, 
Lorna Kooi Simpson.
  My friend Al Simpson and the entire Simpson family lost a wonderful 
mother and caregiver last week. We all have lost one of the greatest 
ladies of Wyoming and the dearest of souls. Her devotion to her family, 
community, State and Nation are a legacy. Indeed she is part of the 
very fabric of Wyoming.
  Lorna Simpson began her long distinguished life on August 19, 1900--
the daughter of a Dutch immigrant. With her family Lorna Simpson moved 
West. In 1929 Lorna married an exceptional young man, a lawyer, from 
Cody, WY--Milward Simpson. He was a State legislator for Wyoming and a 
man destined to lead his State. Together they had two sons, Peter and 
Alan. In Lorna, Milward found an equally dedicated soul and a partner 
to do the work few of us have the means to accomplish.
  Lorna, like the rest of her family, went on to do great things. She 
was a stalwart of her community and State; active in community service, 
business, the war effort and of course politics. 
[[Page S1730]] She was a special young woman who, along with her 
husband, made up one of the most successful and respected teams Wyoming 
has ever known.
  In 1954 Lorna became the First Lady of Wyoming after helping her 
husband become Wyoming's Governor. There in Cheyenne her reputation 
only grew as a caring compassionate person who put so much of her time 
and spirit into the youth of Wyoming.
  Milward Simpson and his dear wife gave their unique talents and 
thoughtful style to Washington in 1962 when Milward served Wyoming 
until 1966 as a Member of this body. During her time here Lorna was 
named by the <strong>Senate</strong> to be the representative of the Women of the United 
States to the Organization of American States. In addition, she worked 
tirelessly to refurbish and extend the use of the <strong>Senate</strong> Chapel.
  Their sons, Pete and Al, have gone on to great things. Pete Simpson 
as the University of Wyoming's vice president for development and 
alumni and university relations, Al Simpson, like his father, of 
course, as one of the most respected Members of this body.
  As a wife, mother, First Lady, adviser, grandmother, and great-
grandmother Lorna Simpson touched countless lives and helped so many 
people. Her accomplishments, the people she touched could never really 
be fully listed.
  Susan and I join so many in grieving the passage of a lady who was 
truly the very best of Wyoming.
  Thank you, Mr. President.
  I yield back the remainder of my time.
