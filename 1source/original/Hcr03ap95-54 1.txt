                         TAX RELIEF FOR AMERICA
  (Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the <strong>House</strong> for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SAM JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, let us review the Democrats' 
reign in power. In 1948 the average family with children paid only 3 
cents of every dollar to the Government. Last year that same family 
lost 24\1/2\ cents in taxes.
  American families now spend more in taxes than on food, clothing, and 
housing combined. The average family losses $10,060 per year of income 
due to taxes.
  Now let us review the Republican plan. Clinton's tax on Social 
Security benefits for seniors will be repealed; families with incomes 
of $25,000 will have their entire Federal income tax liability 
eliminated; 35 million families will have their taxes decreased.
  Which looks better to you, Republican tax relief or the Democrats' 
40-year-old failure of high taxes and runaway spending?
  Let us stop feeding the Federal beast. Let us go for tax relief.
