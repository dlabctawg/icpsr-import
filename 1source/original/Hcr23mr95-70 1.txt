                  PROPOSALS IMPACT ALABAMA'S CHILDREN
  (Mr. HILLIARD asked and was given permission to address the <strong>House</strong> for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HILLIARD. Mr. Speaker, the Republican contract continues to cut 
and slash our child welfare programs and other essential-type programs 
which have never been accused of fraud or abuse.
  The Republican bill simply goes too far. It eliminates many good, 
worthwhile programs which benefit pregnant mothers, infants, children, 
and the elders.
  Yes, Mr. Speaker, the Republican welfare bill is a crude and cruel 
bill which is going to hurt many helpless Americans.
  Mr. Speaker, as most Democrats, I, too, am in favor of a prudent, 
well-thought-out welfare reform bill. When it comes to cutting out 
welfare fraud and fat, I was one of the very first Members of this body 
to call for an investigation of the SSI welfare program which is 
referred to in the press as crazy checks or dummy checks.
  But not since the Biblical days of King Herod have our children been 
in such grave danger. But unlike King Herod, who went only after the 
male child, the Republicans have targeted all of America's poor 
children.
  Mr. Speaker, it is necessary for the Democrats to save our future, to 
save our children, to save America.
