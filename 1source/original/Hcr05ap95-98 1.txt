                         PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY
  Mr. MORAN. I have a parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Goodlatte). The gentleman will state his 
parliamentary inquiry.
  Mr. MORAN. Mr. Speaker, it is my recollection that this body passed 
legislation earlier this term, in fact, on the first day of this 
session, that required that any tax increase be passed with a three-
fifths vote of this body.
  Since there is a tax increase to be leveled on Federal employees, in 
the case of the Federal Employees Retirement System, a 313 percent 
increase on their retirement contribution; in the case of the Civil 
Service Retirement System there was a 35 percent increase in their 
retirement contribution. This is clearly a tax increase, Mr. Speaker.
  Therefore, it seems to me, to be consistent with the legislation this 
body previously passed, it would require a three-fifths vote. I would 
reserve my point of order, but I would make that parliamentary inquiry 
at this time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will take the gentleman's inquiry 
under advisement and rule on it at the appropriate time.
  Mr. MORAN. Mr. Speaker, I would ask, when would be the appropriate 
time for a ruling on this parliamentary inquiry?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pending final passage of the legislation.
  Mr. MORAN. Mr. Speaker, when would I be able to get a division of the 
question on that issue?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will state that the rule relates 
to the vote on passage. The question becomes ripe for the <strong>House</strong> upon 
passage of the legislation.
  Mr. MORAN. Mr. Speaker, the rule said that all points of order are 
waived, but yet I am making an inquiry as to whether this is consistent 
with previously passed legislation of this body.
  It seems to me this then ought to enable us to call for a division as 
to the ruling of the Speaker. What I want to understand is when that 
might occur, when this body might be able to vote on that ruling.
  [[Page H4213]] The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Goodlatte). If the 
gentleman will suspend. At this point the Chair is merely not 
responding to an anticipatory parliamentary inquiry. The Chair will 
rule at the appropriate time.
  Mr. MFUME. When is the appropriate time, Mr. Speaker? When is the 
appropriate time?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The appropriate time is upon final passage.
