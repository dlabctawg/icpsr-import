                RECENT ACTIONS BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT
  (Mr. TORRICELLI asked and was given permission to address the <strong>House</strong> 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. Speaker, several weeks ago the French Government 
was complaining about the activities of American Government officials. 
This came as an enormous surprise. The Japanese, the Germans, and 
Americans did not know there was any technology in France that anybody 
needed.
  Yesterday the French President hosts Fidel Castro.
  Mr. Speaker, we are entitled to doubt whether if there were an island 
in the Mediterranean with a 30-year dictatorship, with no human rights 
for any of its people that the French Government would be so 
understanding.
  In the coming years France will have its difficulties in North 
Africa. Europe has not seen its last internal political problems. I 
trust that all of the people of the Americas will be similarly 
understanding and give the same difference to the French Government 
when it faces its own next crisis.
